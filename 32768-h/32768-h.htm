<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<h3>WHY AND WHEREFORE</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">An</span> ancient writer&mdash;I forget his name&mdash;declared
that in one of the city-states of Greece there was
the rule that when any citizen proposed a new law
or the repeal of an old one, he should come to the
popular assembly with a rope around his neck, and
if his proposition failed of adoption, he was to be
immediately hanged. It is said that amendments
to the constitution of that state were rarely presented,
and the people managed to live under a
few time-honored laws. It is possible that some
such drastic treatment may yet be meted out to
authors&mdash;and perhaps to publishers&mdash;as a last
resort to check the flood of useless literature. To
anticipate this impending constitutional amendment,
it is incumbent upon every writer of a book
to show that his work is needed by the world, and
this I propose to do in these prefatory pages.</p>

<p>Is Chautauqua great enough, original enough,
sufficiently beneficial to the world to have its history
written? We will not accept the votes of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
thousands who beside the lake, in the Hall of
Philosophy, or under the roof of the amphitheater,
have been inoculated with the Chautauqua spirit.
We will seek for the testimony of sane, intelligent,
and thoughtful people, and we will be guided in our
conclusions by their opinions. Let us listen to the
words of the wise and then determine whether
a book about Chautauqua should be published.
We have the utterances by word of mouth and the
written statements of public men, governors,
senators, presidents; of educators, professors, and
college presidents; of preachers and ecclesiastics
in many churches; of speakers upon many platforms;
of authors whose works are read everywhere;
and we present their testimonials as a sufficient
warrant for the preparation and publication
of <i>The Story of Chautauqua</i>.</p>

<p>The Hon. George W. Atkinson, Governor of
West Virginia, visited Chautauqua in 1899, and
in his Recognition Day address on "Modern Educational
Requirements" spoke as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>It (Chautauqua) is the common people's College,
and its courses of instruction are so admirably arranged
that it somehow induces the toiling millions to
voluntarily grapple with all subjects and with all
knowledge.</p>

<p>My Chautauqua courses have taught me that what
we need most is only so much knowledge as we can<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
assimilate and organize into a basis for action; for if
more be given it may become injurious.</p>

<p>Chautauqua is doing more to nourish the intellects
of the masses than any other system of education
extant; except the public schools of the common
country.</p></div>

<p>Here is the testimony of ex-Governor Adolph O.
Eberhardt of Minnesota:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>If I had the choice of being the founder of any great
movement the world has ever known, I would choose
the Chautauqua movement.</p></div>

<p>The Hon. William Jennings Bryan, from the
point of view of a speaker upon many Chautauqua
platforms, wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The privilege and opportunity of addressing from
one to seven or eight thousand of his fellow Americans
in the Chautauqua frame of mind, in the mood which
almost as clearly asserts itself under the tent or amphitheater
as does reverence under the "dim, religious
light"&mdash;this privilege and this opportunity is one of
the greatest that any patriotic American could ask.
It makes of him, if he knows it and can rise to its requirements,
a potent human factor in molding the
mind of the nation.</p></div>

<p>Viscount James Bryce, Ambassador of Great
Britain to the United States, and author of <i>The
American Commonwealth</i>, the most illuminating<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
work ever written on the American system of
government, said, while visiting Chautauqua:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I do not think any country in the world but America
could produce such gatherings as Chautauqua's.</p></div>

<p>Six presidents of the United States have thought
it worth while to visit Chautauqua, either before,
or during, or after their term of office. These were
Grant, Hayes, Garfield, McKinley, Roosevelt, and
Taft. Theodore Roosevelt was at Chautauqua
four times. He said on his last visit, in 1905,
"Chautauqua is the most American thing in
America"; and also:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>This Chautauqua has made the name Chautauqua
a name of a multitude of gatherings all over the Union,
and there is probably no other educational influence
in the country quite so fraught with hope for the future
of the nation as this and the movement of which it is
the archtype.</p></div>

<p>Let us see what some journalists and writers
have said about Chautauqua. Here is the opinion
of Dr. Lyman Abbott, editor of <i>The Outlook</i>, and a
leader of thought in our time:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Chautauqua has inspired the habit of reading with a
purpose. It is really not much use to read, except as
an occasional recreation, unless the reading inspires
one to think his own thoughts, or at least make the
writer's thoughts his own. Reading without reflection,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>
like eating without digestion, produces dyspepsia.
The influence and guidance of Chautauqua will long
be needed in America.</p>

<p>The religious influence of Chautauqua has been not
less valuable. Chautauqua has met the restless questioning
of the age in the only way in which it can be
successfully met, by converting it into a serious seeking
for rest in truth.</p></div>

<p>Dr. Edwin E. Slosson, formerly professor in
Columbia University, now literary editor of the
<i>Independent</i>, wrote in that paper:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>If I were a cartoonist, I should symbolize Chautauqua
by a tall Greek goddess, a sylvan goddess with
leaves in her hair&mdash;not vine leaves, but oak, and tearing
open the bars of a cage wherein had been confined
a bird, say an owl, labeled "Learning." For
that is what Chautauqua has done for the world&mdash;it
has let learning loose.</p></div>

<p>From the American <i>Review of Reviews</i>, July,
1914:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The president of a large technical school is quoted
as having said that ten per cent. of the students in the
institution over which he presides owe their presence
to Chautauqua influence. A talk on civic beauty or
sanitation by an expert from the Chautauqua platform
often results in bringing these matters to local attention
for the first time.</p></div>

<p>Here is an extract from <i>The World To-day<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>:</i></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Old-time politics is dead in the States of the Middle
West. The torchlight parade, the gasoline lamps, and
the street orator draw but little attention. The
"Republican Rally" in the court-house and the "Democratic
Barbecue" in the grove have lost their potency.
People turn to the Chautauquas to be taught politics
along with domestic science, hygiene, and child-welfare.</p></div>

<p>Mr. John Graham Brooks, lecturer on historical,
political, and social subjects, author of works
widely circulated and highly esteemed, has given
courses of lectures at Chautauqua, and has expressed
his estimate in these words:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>After close observation of the work at Chautauqua,
and at other points in the country where its affiliated
work goes on, I can say with confidence that it is
among the most enlightening of our educational agencies
in the United States.</p></div>

<p>Dr. A. V. V. Raymond, while President of Union
College in New York State, gave this testimony:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Chautauqua has its own place in the educational
world, a place as honorable as it is distinctive; and
those of us who are laboring in other fields, by other
methods, have only admiration and praise for the
great work which has made Chautauqua in the best
sense a household word throughout the land.</p></div>

<p>Mr. Edward Howard Griggs, who is in greater
demand than almost any other lecturer on literary<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</a></span>
and historical themes, in his Recognition Day
address, in 1904, on "Culture Through Vocation,"
said as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The Chautauqua movement as conceived by its
leaders is a great movement for cultivating an avocation
apart from the main business of life, not only
giving larger vision, better intellectual training, but
giving more earnest desire and greater ability to serve
and grow through the vocation.</p></div>

<p>This from Dr. William T. Harris, United States
Commissioner of Education:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Think of one hundred thousand persons of mature
age following up a well-selected course of reading for
four years in science and literature, kindling their
torches at a central flame! Think of the millions of
friends and neighbors of this hundred thousand made
to hear of the new ideas and of the inspirations that
result to the workers!</p>

<p>It is a part of the great missionary movement that
began with Christianity and moves onward with Christian
civilization.</p>

<p>I congratulate all members of Chautauqua Reading
Circles on their connection with this great movement
which has begun under such favorable auspices and
has spread so widely, is already world-historical, and is
destined to unfold so many new phases.</p></div>

<p>Prof. Albert S. Cook, of Yale University, wrote
in <i>The Forum<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span>:</i></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>As nearly as I can formulate it, the Chautauqua
Idea is something like this: A fraternal, enthusiastic,
methodical, and sustained attempt to elevate, enrich,
and inspire the individual life in its entirety, by an
appeal to the curiosity, hopefulness, and ambition of
those who would otherwise be debarred from the
greatest opportunities of culture and spiritual advancement.
To this end, all uplifting and stimulating
forces, whether secular or religious, are made to conspire
in their impact upon the person whose weal is
sought.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Can we wonder that Chautauqua is a
sacred and blessed name to multitudes of Americans?</p></div>

<p>The late Principal A. M. Fairbairn, of Mansfield
College, Oxford, foremost among the thinkers of
the last generation, gave many lectures at Chautauqua,
and expressed himself thus:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The C. L. S. C. movement seems to me the most
admirable and efficient organization for the direction
of reading, and in the best sense for popular instruction.
To direct the reading for a period of years for so
many thousands is to affect not only their present culture,
but to increase their intellectual activity for the
period of their natural lives, and thus, among other
things, greatly to add to the range of their enjoyment.
It appears to me that a system which can create such
excellent results merits the most cordial praise from all
lovers of men.</p></div>

<p>Colonel Francis W. Parker, Superintendent of
Schools, first at Quincy, Mass., and later at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[xv]</a></span>
Chicago, one of the leading educators of the land,
gave this testimony, after his visit to Chautauqua:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The New York Chautauqua&mdash;father and mother of
all the other Chautauquas in the country&mdash;is one of the
great institutions founded in the nineteenth century.
It is essentially a school for the people.</p></div>

<p>Prof. Hjalmar H. Boyesen, of Columbia University,
wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Nowhere else have I had such a vivid sense of contact
with what is really and truly American. The
national physiognomy was defined to me as never
before; and I saw that it was not only instinct with
intelligence, earnestness, and indefatigable aspiration,
but that it revealed a strong affinity for all that makes
for righteousness and the elevation of the race. The
confident optimism regarding the future which this
discovery fostered was not the least boon I carried
away with me from Chautauqua.</p></div>

<p>Mrs. Alice Freeman Palmer, President of Wellesley
College, expressed this opinion in a lecture at
Chautauqua:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I could say nothing better than to say over and over
again the great truths Chautauqua has taught to
everyone, that if you have a rounded, completed education
you have put yourselves in relation with all the
past, with all the great life of the present; you have
reached on to the infinite hope of the future.</p>

<p>I venture to say there is no man or woman educating<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[xvi]</a></span>
himself or herself through Chautauqua who will not
feel more and more the opportunity of the present
moment in a present world.</p>

<p>The character of Chautauqua's training has been
that she has made us wiser than we were about things
that last.</p></div>

<p>Rev. Charles M. Sheldon, author of <i>In His Steps</i>,
a story of which three million copies were sold,
said:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>During the past two years I have met nearly a
million people from the platform, and no audiences
have impressed me as have the Chautauqua people for
earnestness, deep purpose, and an honest desire to
face and work out the great issues of American life.</p></div>

<p>This is from the Rev. Robert Stuart MacArthur,
the eminent Baptist preacher:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I regard the Chautauqua Idea as one of the most
important ideas of the hour. This idea, when properly
utilized, gives us a "college at home." It is a genuine
inspiration toward culture, patriotism, and religion.
The general adoption of this course for a generation
would give us a new America in all that is noblest in
culture and character.</p></div>

<p>Dr. Edward Everett Hale, of Boston, Chaplain
of the United States Senate, in his <i>Tarry At Home
Travels</i>, wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>If you have not spent a week at Chautauqua, you
do not know your own country. There, and in no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[xvii]</a></span>
other place known to me, do you meet Baddeck and
Newfoundland and Florida and Tiajuara at the same
table; and there you are of one heart and one soul with
the forty thousand people who will drift in and out&mdash;people
all of them who believe in God and their
country.</p></div>

<p>More than a generation ago, the name of Joseph
Cook was known throughout the continent as a
thinker, a writer, and a lecturer. This is what he
wrote of Chautauqua:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I keep Chautauqua in a fireside nook of my inmost
affections and prayers. God bless the Literary and
Scientific Circle, which is so marvelously successful
already in spreading itself as a young vine over the
trellis-work of many lands! What rich clusters may
ultimately hang on its cosmopolitan branches! It is
the glory of America that it believes that all that anybody
knows everybody should know.</p></div>

<p>Phillips Brooks, perhaps the greatest of American
preachers, spoke as follows in a lecture on
"Literature and Life":</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>May we not believe&mdash;if the students of Chautauqua
be indeed what we have every right to expect that they
will be, men and women thoroughly and healthily alive
through their perpetual contact with the facts of life&mdash;that
when they take the books which have the knowledge
in them, like pure water in silver urns, though
they will not drink as deeply, they will drink more
healthily than many of those who in the deader and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[xviii]</a></span>
more artificial life of college halls bring no such eager
vitality to give value to their draught? If I understand
Chautauqua, this is what it means: It finds its
value in the vitality of its students.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It summons
those who are alive with true human hunger to come
and learn of that great world of knowledge of which he
who knows the most knows such a very little, and feels
more and more, with every increase of his knowledge,
how very little it is that he knows.</p></div>

<p>Julia Ward Howe, author of the song beginning
"Mine eyes have seen the glory," and honored
throughout the land as one of the greatest among
the women of America, wrote as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I am obliged for your kind invitation to be present
at the celebration of the twenty-fifth anniversary of
the founding of Chautauqua Assembly. As I cannot
well allow myself this pleasure, I send you my hearty
congratulations in view of the honorable record of your
association. May its good work long continue, even
until its leaven shall leaven the whole body of our
society.</p></div>

<p>The following letter was received by Dr. Vincent
from one of the most distinguished of the older
poets:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><div class='right'>
April 29, 1882.<br />
</div>

<div><span class="smcap">J. H. Vincent</span>, D.D.,</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Friend</span>: I have been watching the progress
of the Chautauqua Literary and Scientific Circle inaugurated
by thyself, and take some blame to myself
for not sooner expressing my satisfaction in regard to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[xix]</a></span>
its objects and working thus far. I wish it abundant
success, and that its circles, like those from the agitated
center of the Lake, may widen out, until our
entire country shall feel their beneficent influences.
I am very truly thy friend,</p>

<div class='sig'>
<span class="smcap">John G. Whittier.</span><br />
</div></div>

<p>After these endorsements, we may confidently
affirm that a book on Chautauqua, its story, its
principles, and its influence in the world, is warranted.</p>

<p>And now, a few words of explanation as to this
particular book. The tendency in preparing such
a work is to make it documentary, the recital of
programs, speakers, and subjects. In order to
lighten up the pages, I have sought to tell the
story of small things as well as great, the witty as
well as the wise words spoken, the record of by-play
and repartee upon the platform, in those days
when Chautauqua speakers were a fraternity. In
fact, the title by which the body of workers was
known among its members was "the Gang."
Some of these stories are worth preserving, and I
have tried to recall and retain them in these pages.</p>

<h2>The Story of Chautauqua</h2>
<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<h3>THE PLACE</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">John Heyl Vincent</span>&mdash;a name that spells Chautauqua
to millions&mdash;said: "Chautauqua is a <i>place</i>,
an <i>idea</i>, and a <i>force</i>." Let us first of all look at the
place, from which an idea went forth with a living
force into the world.</p>

<p>The State of New York, exclusive of Long Island,
is shaped somewhat like a gigantic foot, the heel
being at Manhattan Island, the crown at the St.
Lawrence River, and the toe at the point where
Pennsylvania touches upon Lake Erie. Near this
toe of New York lies Lake Chautauqua. It is
eighteen miles long besides the romantic outlet of
three miles, winding its way through forest primeval,
and flowing into a shallow stream, the Chadakoin
River, thence in succession into the Allegheny,
the Ohio, the Mississippi, and finally resting in the
bosom of the Gulf of Mexico. As we look at it
upon the map, or sail upon it in the steamer, we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
perceive that it is about three miles across at its
widest points, and moreover that it is in reality two
lakes connected by a narrower channel, almost
separated by two or three peninsulas. The earliest
extant map of the lake, made by the way for
General Washington soon after the Revolution
(now in the Congressional Library at Washington),
represents two separate lakes with a narrow stream
between them. The lake receives no rivers or
large streams. It is fed by springs beneath, and
by a few brooks flowing into it. Consequently its
water is remarkably pure, since none of the surrounding
settlements are permitted to send their
sewage into it.</p>

<p>The surface of Lake Chautauqua is 1350 feet
above the level of the ocean; said to be the highest
navigable water in the United States. This is not
strictly correct, for Lake Tahoe on the boundary
between Nevada and California is more than 6000
feet above sea-level. But Tahoe is navigated only
by motor-boats and small steamers; while Lake
Chautauqua, having a considerable town, Mayville,
at its northern end, Jamestown, a flourishing city
at its outlet, and its shores fringed with villages,
bears upon its bosom many sizable steam-vessels.</p>

<p>It is remarkable that while Lake Erie falls into
the St. Lawrence and empties into the Atlantic at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
iceberg-mantled Labrador and Newfoundland,
Lake Chautauqua only seven miles distant, and
of more than seven hundred feet higher altitude,
finds its resting place in the warm Gulf of Mexico.
Between these two lakes is the watershed for this
part of the continent. An old barn is pointed out,
five miles from Lake Chautauqua, whereof it is
said that the rain falling on one side of its roof runs
into Lake Erie and the St. Lawrence, while the
drops on the other side through a pebbly brook
find their way by Lake Chautauqua into the
Mississippi.</p>

<p>Nobody knows, or will ever know, how this lake
got its smooth-sounding Indian name. Some tell
us that the word means "the place of mists";
others, "the place high up"; still others that its
form, two lakes with a passage between, gave it the
name, "a bag tied in the middle," or "two moccasins
tied together." Mr. Obed Edson of Chautauqua
County, who made a thorough search among
old records and traditions, which he embodied in a
series of articles in <i>The Chautauquan</i> in 1911-12,
gives the following as a possible origin. A party of
Seneca Indians were fishing in the lake and caught
a large muskallonge. They laid it in their canoe,
and going ashore carried the canoe over the well-known
portage to Lake Erie. To their surprise,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
they found the big fish still alive, for it leaped from
the boat into the water, and escaped. Up to that
time, it is said, no muskallonge had ever been
caught in that lake; but the eggs in that fish propagated
their kind, until it became abundant. In the
Seneca language, <i>ga-jah</i> means fish; and <i>ga-da-quah</i>
is "taken out" or as some say, "leaped out." Thus
Chautauqua means "where the fish was taken
out," or "the place of the leaping fish." The name
was smoothed out by the French explorers, who
were the earliest white men in this region, to
"Tchadakoin," still perpetuated in the stream,
Chadakoin, connecting the lake with the Allegheny
River. In an extant letter of George Washington,
dated 1788, the lake is called, "Jadaqua."</p>

<p>From the shore of Lake Erie, where Barcelona
now stands, to the site of Mayville at the head of
Lake Chautauqua ran a well-marked and often-followed
Indian trail, over which canoes and furs
were carried, connecting the Great Lakes with the
river-system of the mid-continent. If among the
red-faced warriors of those unknown ages there had
arisen a Homer to sing the story of his race, a rival
to the Iliad and the Nibelungen might have made
these forests famous, for here was the borderland
between that remarkable Indian confederacy
of central New York, the Iroquois or Five Nations,&mdash;after<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
the addition of the Tuscaroras, the Six
Nations&mdash;those fierce Assyrians of the Western
Continent who barely failed in founding an empire,
and their antagonists the Hurons around Lake Erie.
The two tribes confronting each other were the
Eries of the Huron family and the Senecas of the
Iroquois; and theirs was a life and death struggle.
Victory was with the Senecas, and tradition tells
that the shores of Chautauqua Lake were illuminated
by the burning alive of a thousand Erie
prisoners.</p>

<p>It is said that the first white man to launch his
canoe on Lake Chautauqua was &Eacute;tienne Brule, a
French voyageur. Five years before the landing
of the Pilgrims at Plymouth, with a band of
friendly Hurons he came over the portage from
Lake Erie, and sailed down from Mayville to
Jamestown, thence through the Chadakoin to the
Allegheny and the Ohio, showing to the French
rulers in Canada that by this route lay the path to
empire over the continent.</p>

<p>Fifteen years later, in 1630, La Salle, the indomitable
explorer and warrior, passed over the portage
and down the lake to the river below. Fugitives
from the French settlements in Nova Scotia, the
Acadia of Longfellow's <i>Evangeline</i>, also passed over
the same trail and watercourses in their search for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
a southern home under the French flag. In 1749,
Captain Bienville de Celoron led another company
of pioneers, soldiers, sailors, Indians, and a Jesuit
priest over the same route, bearing with him inscribed
leaden plates to be buried in prominent
places, as tokens of French sovereignty over these
forests and these waters. Being a Frenchman, and
therefore perhaps inclined to gayety, he might have
been happy if he could have foreseen that in a
coming age, the most elaborate amusement park
on the border of Tchadakoin (as he spelled it on
his leaden plates) would hand down the name of
Celoron to generations then unborn!</p>

<span class="caption">Steamer in the Outlet</span>
</div>

<p>In order to make the French domination of this
important waterway sure, Governor Duquesne of
Canada sent across Lake Erie an expedition, landing
at Barcelona, to build a rough wagon-road over
the portage to Lake Chautauqua. Traces of this
"old French road" may still be seen. Those
French surveyors and toilers little dreamed that in
seven years their work would become an English
thoroughfare, and their empire in the new world
would be exploited by the descendants of the
Puritan and Huguenot!</p>

<p>During the American Revolution, the Seneca
tribe of Indians, who had espoused the British side,
established villages at Bemus and Griffiths points<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
on Lake Chautauqua; and a famous British regiment,
"The King's Eighth," still on the rolls of the
British army, passed down the lake, and encamped
for a time beside the Outlet within the present
limits of Jamestown. Thus the redskin, the voyageur,
and the redcoat in turn dipped their paddles
into the placid waters of Lake Chautauqua. They
all passed away, and the American frontiersman
took their place; he too was followed by the farmer
and the vinedresser. In the last half of the nineteenth
century a thriving town, Mayville, was
growing at the northern end of the lake; the city of
Jamestown was rising at the end of the Outlet;
while here and there along the shores were villages
and hamlets; roads, such as they were before the
automobile compelled their improvement, threaded
the forests and fields. A region situated on the
direct line of travel between the east and the west,
and also having Buffalo on the north and Pittsburgh
on the south, could not long remain secluded.
Soon the whistle of the locomotive began to wake
the echoes of the surrounding hills.</p>

<p>In its general direction the lake lies southeast
and northwest, and its widest part is about three
miles south of Mayville. Here on its northwestern
shore a wide peninsula reaches forth into the water.
At the point it is a level plain, covered with stately<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
trees; on the land side it rises in a series of natural
terraces marking the altitude and extent of the
lake in prehistoric ages; for the present Chautauqua
Lake is only the shrunken hollow of a vaster
body in the geologic periods. In the early 'seventies
of the last century this peninsula was known as
Fair Point; but in a few years, baptized with a
new name <span class="smcap">Chautauqua</span>, it was destined to make
the little lake famous throughout the world and to
entitle an important chapter in the history of
education.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<h3>THE FOUNDERS</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Every</span> idea which becomes a force in the world
has its primal origin in a living man or woman.
It drops as a seed into one mind, grows up to fruitage,
and from one man is disseminated to a multitude.
The Chautauqua Idea became incarnate in
two men, John Heyl Vincent and Lewis Miller,
and by their co&ouml;rdinated plans and labors made
itself a mighty power. Let us look at the lives of
these two men, whose names are ever one in the
minds of intelligent Chautauquans.</p>

<p>John Heyl Vincent was of Huguenot ancestry.
The family came from the canton of Rochelle, a
city which was the Protestant capital of France
in the period of the Reformation. From this
vicinity Levi Vincent (born 1676), a staunch Protestant,
emigrated to America in the persecuting days
of Louis XIV., and settled first at New Rochelle,
N. Y., later removed to New Jersey, and died there
in 1736. For several generations the family lived
in New Jersey; but at the time of John Heyl Vincent's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
birth on February 23, 1832, his father,
John Himrod Vincent, the great-great-grandson of
the Huguenot refugee, was dwelling at Tuscaloosa,
Alabama. Dr. Vincent used to say that he began
his ministry before he was six years old, preaching
to the little negroes around his home. The family
moved during his early childhood to a farm near
Lewisburg, Pa., on Chillisquasque Creek, where at
the age of fifteen he taught in the public school.</p>

<p>When not much above sixteen he was licensed as
a local preacher in the Methodist Episcopal Church.
He soon became a junior preacher on a four weeks'
circuit along the Lehigh River, which at that time
seems to have been in the bounds of the old Baltimore
Conference. He rode his circuit on horseback,
with a pair of saddlebags behind him, and boarded
'round among his parishioners. His saintly mother,
of whose character and influence he always spoke
in the highest reverence, died at this time, and
soon after he went to visit relatives in Newark,
N. J. There he served as an assistant in the city
mission, and at the same time studied in the
Wesleyan Academy on High Street. A fellow
student, who became and continued through a
long life one of his most intimate friends, the Rev.
George H. Whitney, said that young Vincent
differed from most of his classmates in his eager<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
desire for education, his appetite for book-knowledge
leading him to read almost every volume that
came his way, and his visions, then supposed to be
mere dreams, of plans for the intellectual uplift of
humanity. It was his keenest sorrow that he could
not realize his intense yearning for a course in
college; but perhaps his loss in youth became a
nation's gain in his maturer years.</p>

<p>In 1853 he was received formally as a member
"on trial" in the New Jersey Conference, at that
time embracing the entire State. His first charge
as pastor was at North Belleville, later known as
Franklin, now Nutley, where a handsome new
church bears his name and commemorates his early
ministry. His second charge was at a small suburb
of Newark, then called Camptown, now the thriving
borough of Irvington. His ministry from the
beginning had been marked by an interest in childhood
and youth, and a strong effort to strengthen
the work of the Sunday School. At Camptown he
established a definite course of Bible teaching for
teachers and young people. Near the church he
staked out a map of Palestine, marked its mountains
and streams, its localities and battlefields,
and led his teachers and older scholars on pilgrimages
from Dan to Beersheba, pausing at each of the
sacred places while a member of the class told its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
story. The lessons of that Palestine Class, taught
on the peripatetic plan in the fifties, are still in
print, showing the requirements for each successive
grade of Pilgrim, Resident in Palestine, Dweller
in Jerusalem, Explorer of other Bible Lands, and
after a final and searching examination, Templar,
wearing a gold medal. At each of his pastoral
charges after this, he conducted his Palestine
Class and constructed his outdoor map of the
Holy Land. May we not find here the germ destined
to grow into the Palestine Park of the
Chautauqua Assembly?</p>

<p>After four years in New Jersey young Vincent
was transferred in 1857 to Illinois, where in succession
he had charge of four churches, beginning with
Joliet, where he met a young lady teacher, Miss
Elizabeth Dusenbury, of Portville, N. Y., who
became his wife, and in the after years by her warm
heart, clear head, and wise judgment greatly contributed
to her husband's success. He was a year
at Mount Morris, the seat of the Rock River Conference
Seminary, at which he studied while pastor
in the community. For two years, 1860 and '61,
he was at Galena, and found in his congregation a
quiet ex-army officer, named Ulysses S. Grant, who
afterward said when introducing him to President
Lincoln, "Dr. Vincent was my pastor at Galena,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
Ill., and I do not think that I missed one of his
sermons while I lived there." Long after the Civil
War days Bishop Vincent expressed in some autobiographical
notes his estimate of General Grant.
He wrote: "General Grant was one of the loveliest
and most reverent of men. He had a strong will
under that army overcoat of his, but he was the
soul of honor and as reverent as he was brave."
After two years at Rockford&mdash;two years having
been until 1864 the limit for a pastorate in American
Methodism&mdash;in 1865 he was appointed to
Trinity Church, Chicago, then the most important
church of his denomination in that city.</p>

<p>Chicago opened the door of opportunity to a
wider field. The pastor of Trinity found in that
city a group of young men, enthusiasts in the
Sunday School, and progressive in their aims. Dr.
Vincent at once became a leader among them and
by their aid was able to introduce a Uniform
Lesson in the schools of the city. He established
in 1865 a <i>Sunday School Quarterly</i>, which in the
following years became the <i>Sunday School Teacher</i>,
in its editorials and its lesson material setting a
new standard for Sunday School instruction. His
abilities were soon recognized by the authorities in
his church, and he was called to New York to
become first General Agent of the Sunday School<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
Union, the organization directing Methodist Episcopal
Sunday Schools throughout the world, and in
1868, secretary and editor. He organized and set
in circulation the Berean Uniform Lessons for his
denomination, an important link in the chain of
events which in 1873 made the Sunday School
lessons uniform throughout America and the world.
It is the fashion now to depreciate the Uniform
Lesson Plan as unpedagogic and unpsychologic;
but its inauguration was the greatest forward step
ever taken in the evolution of the Sunday School;
for it instituted systematic study of the Bible, and
especially of the Old Testament; it brought to the
service of the teacher the ablest Bible scholars on
both sides of the Atlantic; it enabled the teachers
of a school, a town, or a city to unite in the preparation
of their lessons. Chicago, New York, Brooklyn,
Boston, and many other places soon held study-classes
of Sunday School teachers, of all grades,
of a thousand or more gathered on a week-day to
listen to the lectures of great instructors. The
Plainfield (N. J.) Railroad Class was not the only
group of Sunday School workers who spent their
hour on the train passing to and from business in
studying together their Sunday School lesson.</p>

<span class="caption">Old Business Block and Post-Office</span>
</div>

<p>Soon after Dr. Vincent assumed the charge of
general Sunday School work, having his office in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
New York, he took up his residence in Plainfield,
N. J., a suburban city which felt his influence and
responded to it for twenty years. Having led the
way to one summit in his ideals, he saw other
mountain-heights beyond, and continually pointed
his followers upward. When he succeeded to the
editorship of the <i>Sunday School Journal</i>, the
teachers' magazine of his church, he found a circulation
of about five thousand. With the Uniform
Lesson, and his inspiring editorials, it speedily rose
to a hundred thousand, and a few years later to
two hundred thousand subscribers, while his lesson
leaves and quarterlies went into the millions. With
voice&mdash;that wonderful, awakening, thrilling voice&mdash;and
with a pen on fire, he appealed everywhere
for a training that should fit Sunday School
teachers for their great work. He established in
many places the Normal Class, and marked out a
course of instruction for its students. This was
the step which led directly to the <i>Chautauqua
Assembly</i>, which indeed made some such institution
a necessity.</p>

<p>The Normal Class proposed a weekly meeting of
Sunday School teachers or of young people seeking
preparation for teaching, a definite course of study,
examinations at regular stages, and a diploma to
those who met its standards. Dr. Vincent conceived<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
the plan of bringing together a large body of
teacher-students, who should spend at least a fortnight
in daily study, morning and afternoon, and
thus accomplish more work than in six months of
weekly meetings. He aimed also to have lectures
on inspiring themes, with a spice of entertainment
to impart variety. While this ideal was rising
before him and shaping in his mind, he found a
kindred spirit, a genius in invention, and a practical,
wise business man whose name was destined
to stand beside his own in equal honor wherever
and whenever Chautauqua is named&mdash;Lewis
Miller of Akron, Ohio, the first and until his death
in 1899 the only president of Chautauqua.</p>

<p>Lewis Miller was born on July 24, 1829, at Greentown,
Ohio. He received in his childhood the
limited education in "the three R's&mdash;reading,
'riting and 'rithmetic," usual in the country school;
and at the age of sixteen was himself a school
teacher. In 1849, twenty years old, he began work
at the plastering trade, but at the same time was
attending school. He became a partner in the
manufacturing firm of Aultman, Ball and Co.,
which soon became Aultman, Miller and Co., and
was removed from Greentown to Canton, Ohio.
Here, about 1857, Mr. Miller invented and put
into successful operation the Buckeye Mower and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
Reaper, which made him famous, and with other
inventions brought to him a fortune. His home
was for many years, and until his death, at Akron.
From his earliest years he was interested in education,
and especially in education through the
Sunday School. He became Sunday School Superintendent
of the First Methodist Episcopal Church
in Akron, and made it more than most of the Sunday
Schools in that generation a <i>school</i>, and not
merely a meeting for children. He organized a
graded system and required his pupils to pass from
grade to grade through the door of an examination
in Bible knowledge. He was one of the earliest
Sunday School superintendents to organize a
Normal Class for the equipment and training of
young people for teaching in his school. At a
certain stage in the promotions every young man
and young woman passed one year or two years in
the Normal Grade; for which he arranged the
course until one was provided by Dr. Vincent after
he became Secretary of Sunday School work for
the denomination in 1868; and in the planning of
that early normal course, Mr. Miller took an active
part, for he met in John H. Vincent one who, like
himself, held inspiring ideals for the Sunday School,
and the two leaders were often in consultation.
It was an epoch in the history of the American<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
Sunday School when Mr. Miller built the first
Sunday School hall in the land according to a plan
originated by himself; its architectural features
being wrought out under his direction by his fellow-townsman
and friend, Mr. Jacob Snyder, an
architect of distinction. In this building, then
unique but now followed by thousands of churches,
there was a domed central assembly hall, with
rooms radiating from it in two stories, capable of
being open during the general exercises, but closed
in the lesson period so that each class could be
alone with its teacher while studying.</p>

<p>Mr. Miller was also interested in secular education,
was for years president of the Board of Education
in Akron, always aiming for higher standards
in teaching. He was also a trustee of Mount Union
College in his own State. Two men such as Vincent
and Miller, both men of vision, both leaders
in education through the Sunday School, both aiming
to make that institution more efficient, would
inevitably come together; and it was fortunate
that they were able to work hand in hand, each
helping the other.</p>

<p>These two men had thoughts of gatherings of
Sunday School workers, not in conventions, to
hear reports and listen to speeches, not to go for
one-day or two- or three-day institutes, but to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
spend weeks together in studying the Bible and
methods of Sunday School work. They talked over
their plans, and they found that while they had
much in common in their conception each one
could supplement the other in some of the details.
It had been Dr. Vincent's purpose to hold his
gathering of Sunday School workers and Bible
students within the walls of a large church, in some
city centrally located and easily reached by railroad.
He suggested to Mr. Miller that his new
Sunday School building, with its many classrooms
opening into one large assembly hall, would be a
suitable place for launching the new enterprise.</p>

<p>One cannot help asking the question&mdash;what
would have been the result if Dr. Vincent's proposal
had been accepted, and the first Sunday
School Assembly had been held in a city and a
church? Surely the word "Chautauqua" would
never have appeared as the name of a new and
mighty movement in education. Moreover, it is
almost certain that the movement itself would
never have arisen to prominence and to power.
It is a noteworthy fact that no Chautauqua Assembly
has ever succeeded, though often attempted,
in or near a large city. One of the most striking
and drawing features of the Chautauqua movement
has been its out-of-doors and in-the-woods<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
habitat. The two founders did not dream in those
days of decision that the fate of a great educational
system was hanging in the balance.</p>

<p>An inspiration came to Lewis Miller to hold the
projected series of meetings in a forest, and under
the tents of a camp meeting. Camp meetings had
been held in the United States since 1799, when
the first gathering of this name took place in a
grove on the banks of the Red River in Kentucky
led by two brothers McGee, one a Presbyterian,
the other a Methodist. In those years churches
were few and far apart through the hamlets and
villages of the west and south. The camp meeting
brought together great gatherings of people who
for a week or more listened to sermons, held almost
continuous prayer meetings, and called sinners to
repentance. The interest died down somewhat in
the middle of the nineteenth century, but following
the Civil War, a wave of enthusiasm for camp
meetings swept over the land. In hundreds of
groves, east and west, land was purchased or leased,
lots were sold, tents were pitched, and people by
the thousand gathered for soul-stirring services.
In one of the oldest and most successful of these
camp meetings, that on Martha's Vineyard, tents
had largely given place to houses, and a city had
arisen in the forest. This example had been followed,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
and on many camp-meeting grounds houses
of a primitive sort straggled around the open circle
where the preaching services were held. Most of
these buildings were mere sheds, destitute of
architectural beauty, and innocent even of paint
on their walls of rough boards. Many of these
antique structures may still be seen at Chautauqua,
survivals of the camp-meeting period, in
glaring contrast with the more modern summer
homes beside them.</p>

<p>At first Dr. Vincent did not take kindly to the
thought of holding his training classes and their
accompaniments in any relationship to a camp
meeting or even upon a camp ground. He was not
in sympathy with the type of religious life manifested
and promoted at these gatherings. The fact
that they dwelt too deeply in the realm of emotion
and excitement, that they stirred the feelings to
the neglect of the reasoning and thinking faculties,
that the crowd called together on a camp-meeting
ground would not represent the sober, sane,
thoughtful element of church life&mdash;all these repelled
Dr. Vincent from the camp meeting.</p>

<p>Mr. Miller had recently become one of the trustees
of a camp meeting held at Fair Point on Lake
Chautauqua, and proposed that Dr. Vincent
should visit the place with him. Somewhat unwillingly,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
yet with an open mind, Vincent rode
with Miller by train to Lakewood near the foot of
the lake, and then in a small steamer sailed to
Fair Point. A small boy was with them, sitting
in the prow of the boat, and as it touched the
wharf he was the first of its passengers to leap
on the land&mdash;and in after years, George Edgar
Vincent, LL.D., was wont to claim that he, at the
mature age of nine years, was the original discoverer
of Chautauqua!</p>

<p>It was in the summer of 1873, soon after the
fourth session of the Erie Conference Camp Meeting
of the Methodist Episcopal Church, that Dr.
Vincent came, saw, and was conquered. His normal
class and its subsidiary lectures and entertainments
should be held under the beeches, oaks,
and maples shading the terraced slopes rising up
from Lake Chautauqua.</p>

<p>A lady who had attended the camp meeting in
1871, its second session upon the grounds at Fair
Point, afterward wrote her first impressions of the
place. She said that the superintendent of the
grounds, Mr. Pratt (from whom an avenue at
Chautauqua received its name some years afterward),
told her that until May, 1870, "the sound of
an axe had not been heard in those woods." This
lady (Mrs. Kate P. Bruch) wrote:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Many of the trees were immense in size, and in all
directions, from the small space occupied by those
who were tenting there, we could walk through seas of
nodding ferns; while everywhere through the forest
was a profusion of wild flowers, creeping vines, murmuring
pine, beautiful mosses and lichens. The lake
itself delighted us with its lovely shores; where either
highly cultivated lands dotted with farmhouses, or
stretches of pine forest, met on all sides the cool, clear
water that sparkled or danced in the sunlight, or gave
subdued but beautiful reflection of the moonlight.
We were especially charmed with the narrow, tortuous
outlet of the lake&mdash;then so closely resembling the
streams of tropical climes. With the trees pressing
closely to the water's edge, covered with rich foliage,
tangled vines clinging and swaying from their branches;
and luxuriant undergrowth, through which the bright
cardinal flowers were shining, it was not difficult to
fancy one's self far from our northern clime, sailing
over water that never felt the cold clasp of frost and
snow.</p></div>

<p>The steamers winding their way through the
romantic outlet were soon to be laden with new
throngs looking for the first time upon forest,
farms, and lake. Those ivy-covered and moss-grown
terraces of Fair Point were soon to be
trodden by the feet of multitudes; and that camp-meeting
stand from which fervent appeals to repentance
had sounded forth, to meet responses of
raptured shouts from saints, and cries for mercy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
from seekers, was soon to become the arena for
religious thought and aspiration of types contrasted
with those of the camp meeting of former
years.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<h3>SOME PRIMAL PRINCIPLES</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">We</span> have looked at the spot chosen for this new
movement, and we have become somewhat acquainted
with its two leaders. Let us now look at
its foundations, and note the principles upon which
it was based. We shall at once perceive that the
original plans of the Fair Point Assembly were
very narrow in comparison with those of Chautauqua
to-day. Yet those aims were of such a
nature, like a Gothic Church, as would readily
lend themselves to enlargement on many sides,
and only add to the unique beauty of the structure.</p>

<p>In this chapter we are not undertaking to set
forth the Chautauqua Idea, as it is now realized&mdash;for
everybody, everywhere, and in every
department of knowledge, inspired by a Christian
faith. Whatever may have been in the mind of
either founder, this wide-reaching aim was not in
those early days made known. Both Miller and
Vincent were interested in education, and each of
them felt his own lack of college training, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
during the first three or four years of Chautauqua's
history all its aims were in the line of religious
education through the Sunday School. We are
not to look for the traits of its later development,
in those primal days. Ours is the story of an evolution,
and not a philosophical treatise.</p>

<p>The first assembly on Chautauqua Lake was
held under the sanction and direction of the governing
Sunday School Board of the Methodist
Episcopal Church, by resolution of the Board in
New York at its meeting in October, 1873, in response
to a request from the executive committee
of the Chautauqua Lake Camp Ground Association,
and upon the recommendation of Dr. Vincent,
whose official title was Corresponding Secretary of
the Sunday School Union of the Methodist Episcopal
Church. The Normal Committee of the
Union was charged with the oversight of the
projected meetings; Lewis Miller was appointed
President, and John H. Vincent, Superintendent
of Instruction.</p>

<p>Although held upon a camp ground and inheriting
some of the camp-meeting opportunities, the
gathering was planned to be unlike a camp meeting
in its essential features, and to reach a constituency
outside that of the camp ground. Its
name was a new one, "The Assembly," and its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
sphere was announced to be that of the Sunday
School. There was to be a definite and carefully
prepared program of a distinctly educational cast,
with no opening for spontaneous, go-as-you-please
meetings to be started at any moment. This was
arranged to keep a quietus on both the religious
enthusiast and the wandering Sunday School orator
who expected to make a speech on every
occasion. On my first visit to Fair Point&mdash;which
was not in '74 but in '75&mdash;I found a prominent
Sunday School talker from my own State, grip-sack
in hand, leaving the ground. He explained,
"This is no place for me. They have a cut-and-dried
program, and a fellow can't get a word in
anywhere. I'm going home. Give me the convention
where a man can speak if he wants to."</p>

<p>In most of the camp meetings, but not in all,
Sunday was the great day, a picnic on a vast scale,
bringing hundreds of stages, carryalls, and wagons
from all quarters, special excursion trains loaded
with visitors, fleets of boats on the lake or river,
if the ground could be reached by water route.
No doubt some good was wrought. Under the
spell of a stirring preacher some were turned from
sin to righteousness. But much harm was also
done, in the emptying of churches for miles around,
the bringing together of a horde of people intent on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
pleasure, and utter confusion taking the place of
a sabbath-quiet which should reign on a ground
consecrated to worship. Against this desecration
of the holy day, Miller and Vincent set themselves
firmly. As a condition of accepting the invitation
of the Camp Meeting Association to hold the proposed
Assembly at Fair Point, the gates were to be
absolutely closed against all visitors on Sunday;
and notice was posted that no boats would be
allowed to land on that day at the Fair Point pier.
In those early days everybody came to Fair Point
by boat. There was indeed a back-door entrance
on land for teams and foot passengers; but few
entered through it. In these modern days of electricity,
now that the lake is girdled with trolley
lines, and a hundred automobiles stand parked
outside the gates, the back door has become the
front door, and the steamboats are comparatively
forsaken.</p>

<p>In addition to the name Assembly, the exact
order of exercises, and the closed ground on Sunday,
there was another startling departure from
camp-meeting usages&mdash;a gate fee. The overhead
expenses of a camp meeting were comparatively
light. Those were not the days when famous
evangelists like Sam Jones and popular preachers
such as DeWitt Talmage received two hundred<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
dollars for a Sunday sermon. Board and keep were
the rewards of the ministers, and the "keep" was
a bunk in the preachers' tent. The needed funds
were raised by collections, which though nominally
"voluntary" were often obtained under high-pressure
methods. But the Assembly, with well-known
lecturers, teachers of recognized ability, and
the necessary nation-wide advertising to awaken
interest in a new movement would of necessity be
expensive. How should the requisite dollars by
the thousand be raised? The two heads of the
Assembly resolved to dispense with the collections,
and have a gate fee for all comers. Fortunately
the Fair Point grounds readily lent themselves to
this plan, for they were already surrounded on
three sides by a high picket-fence, and only the
small boys knew where the pickets were loose, and
they didn't tell.</p>





<p>The Sunday closing and the entrance charge
raised a storm of indignation all around the lake.
The steamboat owners&mdash;in those days there were
no steamer corporations; each boat big or little,
was owned by its captain&mdash;the steamboat owners
saw plainly that Sunday would be a "lost day"
to them if the gates were closed; and the thousands
of visitors to the camp meeting who had squeezed
out a dime, or even a penny, when the basket went<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
around, bitterly complained outside the gates at a
quarter for daily admission, half of what they had
cheerfully handed over when the annual circus
came to town. During the first Assembly in 1874,
the gatekeepers needed all their patience and
politeness to restrain some irate visitors from
coming to blows over the infringement of their
right to free entrance upon the Fair Point Camp
Ground. There were holders of leases upon lots
who expected free entrance for themselves and
their families&mdash;and "family" was stretched to
include visitors. Then there were the preachers
who could not comprehend why <i>they</i> should buy
a ticket for entrance to the holy ground! The
financial and restrictive regulations were left
largely to Lewis Miller, who possessed the <i>suaviter
in modo</i> so graciously that many failed to realize
underneath it the <i>fortiter in re</i>. Behind that
smiling countenance of the President of Chautauqua
was an uncommonly stiff backbone. Rules
once fixed were kept in the teeth of opposition from
both sinners and saints.</p>

<p>Let me anticipate some part of our story by
saying that at the present time there are from six
to eight hundred all-the-year residents upon
Chautauqua grounds. Before the Assembly opens
on July 1st, every family must obtain season<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
tickets to the public exercises for all except the very
youngest members and bedridden invalids. A
lease upon Chautauqua property does not entitle
the holder to admission to the grounds. If he
owns an automobile, it must be parked outside,
and cannot be brought through the gates without
the payment of an entrance fee, and an officer
riding beside the chauffeur to see that in Chautauqua's
narrow streets and thronged walks all
care is taken against accident. The only exception
to this rule is in favor of physicians who are
visiting patients within the enclosure.</p>

<p>The catholicity of the plans for the first Assembly
must not be forgotten. Both its founders were
members of the Methodist Episcopal Church and
loyal to its institutions. But they were also believers
in and members of the Holy Catholic
Church, the true church of Christ on earth, wherein
every Christian body has a part. They had no
thought to ignore the various denominations, but
aimed to make every follower of Christ at home.
Upon the program appeared the names of men
eminent in all the churches; and it was a felicitous
thought to hold each week on one evening the
prayer meetings of the several churches, each by
itself, also to plan on one afternoon in different
places on the ground, for denominational conferences<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
where the members of each church could
freely discuss their own problems and provide for
their own interests. This custom established at
the first assembly has become one of the traditions
of Chautauqua. Every Wednesday evening, from
seven to eight, is assigned for denominational
prayer meetings, and on the second Wednesday
afternoon in August, two hours are set apart for
the Denominational Conferences. The author of
this volume knows something about one of those
meetings; for year after year it has brought him to
his wit's end, to provide a program that will not
be a replica of the last one, and then sometimes, to
persuade the conferences to confer. But if a list
were made of the noble names that have taken
part in these gatherings, it would show that the
interdenominational plan of the founders has been
justified by the results. It is a great fact that for
nearly fifty years the loyal members of almost
every church in the land have come together at
Chautauqua, all in absolute freedom to speak
their minds, yet with never the least friction or
controversy. And this relation was not one of an
armed neutrality between bodies in danger of
breaking out into open war. It did not prevent a
good-natured raillery on the Chautauqua platform
between speakers of different denominations.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
If anyone had a joke at the expense of the Baptists
or the Methodists or the Presbyterians, he never
hesitated to tell it before five thousand people,
even with the immediate prospect of being demolished
by a retort from the other side.</p>

<p>A conversation that occurred at least ten years
after the session of '74 belongs here logically, if not
chronologically. A tall, long-coated minister
whose accent showed his nativity in the southern
mountain-region said to me, "I wish to inquire,
sir, what is the doctrinal platform of this
assembly." "There is none, so far as I know," I
answered. "You certainly do not mean, sir,"
he responded, "that there is not an understanding
as to the doctrines allowed to be taught on this
platform. Is there no statement in print of the
views that must or must not be expressed by the
different speakers?" "I never heard of any," I
said, "and if there was such a statement I think
that I should know about it." "What, sir, is
there to prevent any speaker from attacking the
doctrines of some other church, or even from
speaking against the fundamental doctrines of
Christianity?" "Nothing in the world," I said,
"except that nobody at Chautauqua ever wishes
to attack any other Christian body. If anyone
did such a thing, I don't believe that it would be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
thought necessary to disown or even to answer
him. But I am quite certain that it would be his
last appearance on the Chautauqua platform."</p>

<p>In this chapter I have sought to point out the
foundation stones of Chautauqua, as they were
laid nearly half a century ago. Others were placed
later in the successive years; but these were the
original principles, and these have been maintained
for more than a generation. Let us fix them in
memory by a restatement and an enumeration.
First, Chautauqua, now an institution for general
and popular education, began in the department of
religion as taught in the Sunday School. Second,
it was an out-of-doors school, held in the forest,
blazing the way and setting the pace of summer
schools in the open air throughout the nation and
the world. Third, although held upon a camp-meeting
ground it was widely different in aim and
method, spirit and clientele from the old-fashioned
camp meeting. Fourth, it maintained the sanctity
of the Sabbath, closed its gates, and frowned upon
every attempt to secularize or commercialize the
holy day, or to make it a day of pleasure. Fifth,
the enterprise was supported, not by collections
at its services, or by contributions from patrons,
but by a fee upon entrance from every comer.
Sixth, it was to represent not one branch of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
church, but to bring together all the churches in
acquaintance and friendship, to promote, not
church union, but church unity. And seventh,
let it be added that it was to be in no sense a money-making
institution. There were trustees but no
stockholders, and no dividends. If any funds remained
after paying the necessary expenses, they
were to be used for improvement of the grounds
or the enlargement of the program. Upon these
foundations Chautauqua has stood and has grown
to greatness.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<h3>THE BEGINNINGS</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">But</span> let us come to the opening session of the
Assembly, destined to greater fortune and fame
than even its founders at that time dreamed. It
was named "The Sunday School Teachers' Assembly,"
for the wider field of general education
then lay only in the depths of one founder's mind.
For the sake of history, let us name the officers of
this first Assembly. They were as follows:</p>


<div class='center'>

<p>The property of the Camp Meeting Association,
leased for the season to the Assembly, embraced
less than one fourth of the present dimensions of
Chautauqua, even without the golf course and
other property outside the gates. East and west it
extended as it does now from the Point and the
Pier to the public highway. But on the north
where Kellogg Memorial Hall now stands was the
boundary indicated by the present Scott Avenue,
though at that time unmarked. The site of Normal
Hall and all north of it were outside the fence.
And on the south its boundary was the winding
way of Palestine Avenue. The ravine now covered
by the Amphitheater was within the bounds, but
the site of the Hotel Athen&aelig;um was without the
limit.</p>

<p>He who rambles around Chautauqua in our day
sees a number of large, well-kept hotels, and many
inns and "cottages" inviting the visitor to comfortable
rooms and bountiful tables. But in those
early days there was not one hotel or boarding-house
at Fair Point. Tents could be rented, and a
cottager might open a room for a guest, but it was
forbidden to supply table board for pay. Everybody,
except such as did their own cooking, ate
their meals at the dining-hall, which was a long
tabernacle of rough unpainted boards, with a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
leaky roof, and backless benches where the feeders
sat around tables covered with oilcloth. And as
for the meals&mdash;well, if there was high thinking
at Chautauqua there was certainly plain living.
Sometimes it rained, and D.D.'s, LL.D.'s, professors,
and plain people held up umbrellas with one
hand and tried to cut tough steaks with the other.
But nobody complained at the fare, for the feast
of reason and flow of soul made everybody forget
burnt potatoes and hard bread.</p>

<p>What is now Miller Park, the level ground and
lovely grove at the foot of the hill, was then the
Auditorium, where stood a platform and desk
sheltered from sun on some days and rain on others.
Before it was an array of seats, lacking backs,
instead of which the audience used their own backbones.
Perhaps two thousand people could find
sitting-room under the open sky, shaded by the
noble trees. A sudden shower would shoot up a
thousand umbrellas. One speaker said that happening
to look up from his manuscript he perceived
that an acre of toadstools had sprouted in a minute.
At the lower end of this park stood the tent wherein
Dr. Vincent dwelt during many seasons; at the
upper end was the new cottage of the Miller family
with a tent frame beside it for guests. At this
Auditorium all the great lectures were given for the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
first four years of Chautauqua history, except when
continued rain forbade. Then an adjournment,
sometimes hasty, was made to a large tent up the
hill, known as the Tabernacle.</p>

<p>One day, during the second season of the
Assembly in 1875, Professor William F. Sherwin,
singer, chorus leader, Bible teacher, and wit of the
first water, was conducting a meeting in the Auditorium.
The weather had been uncertain, an
"open and shut day," and people hardly knew
whether to meet for Sherwin's service in the grove
or in the tent on the hill. Suddenly a tall form,
well known at Chautauqua, came tearing down the
hill and up the steps of the platform, breathless,
wild-eyed, with mop of hair flying loose, bursting
into the professor's address with the words, "Professor
Sherwin, I come as a committee of fifty to
invite you to bring your meeting up to the Tabernacle,
safe from the weather, where a large crowd
is gathered!" "Well," responded Sherwin, "you
may be a committee of fifty, but you look like
sixty!" And from that day ever after at Chautauqua
a highly respected gentleman from Washington,
D.C., was universally known as "the man who
looks like sixty."</p>

<p>When we speak of Sherwin, inevitably we think
of Frank Beard, the cartoonist, whose jokes were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
as original as his pictures. He would draw in
presence of the audience a striking picture, seemingly
serious, and then in a few quick strokes transform
it into something absurdly funny. For
instance, his "Moses in the Bulrushes" was a
beautiful baby surrounded by waving reeds. A
sudden twist of the crayon, and lo, a wild bull was
charging at the basket and its baby. This was
"The Bull Rushes." Beard was as gifted with
tongue as with pen, and in the comradeship of the
Chautauqua platform he and Sherwin were continually
hurling jokes at each other. Oftentimes
the retort was so pat that one couldn't help an
inward question whether the two jesters had not
arranged it in advance.</p>

<p>Frank Beard used to hold a question drawer
occasionally. There was a show of collecting
questions from the audience, but those to be
answered had been prepared by Mr. Beard and his
equally witty wife, and written on paper easily
recognized. One by one, these were taken out,
read with great dignity, and answered in a manner
that kept the crowd in a roar. On one occasion
Professor Sherwin was presiding at Mr. Beard's
question drawer&mdash;for it was the rule that at every
meeting there must be a chairman as well as the
speaker. The question was drawn out, "Will Mr.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
Beard please explain the difference between a
natural consequence and a miracle?" Mr. Beard
<i>did</i> explain thus: "This difficult question can be
answered by a very simple illustration. There is
Professor Sherwin. If Professor Sherwin says to
me, 'Mr. Beard, lend me five dollars,' and I should
let him have it, that would be a <i>natural consequence</i>.
If Professor Sherwin should ever pay it
back, <i>that</i> would be a miracle!" It is needless to
say that the opportunity soon arrived for Mr.
Sherwin to repay Mr. Beard for full value of debt
with abundant interest.</p>

<p>Mention has been made that at each address or
public platform meeting a chairman must be in
charge. In the old camp-meeting days all the
ministers had been wont to sit on the platform
behind the preacher; and some of them could not
reconcile themselves to Dr. Vincent's rule that
<i>only</i> the chairman and the speaker of the hour
should occupy "the preachers' stand." Notwithstanding
repeated announcements, some clergymen
continued to invade the platform. The head of the
Department of Order once pointed to a well-known
minister and said to the writer, "Four times I
have told that man&mdash;and a good man he is&mdash;that
he must not take a seat on the platform." Whoever
casts his eyes on the platform of the Amphitheater<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
may notice that before every public service,
the janitor places just the number of chairs needed,
and no more. This is one of the Chautauqua
traditions, begun under the Vincent r&eacute;gime.</p>

<p>Before we come to the more serious side of our
story let us notice another instance of the contrast
between the camp meeting and Chautauqua. A
widely known Methodist came, bringing with him
a box of revival song-books, compiled by himself.
He was a leader of a "praying band," and accustomed
to hold meetings where the enthusiasm was
pumped up to a high pitch. One Sunday at a certain
hour he noticed that the Auditorium in the
grove was unoccupied; and gathering a group of
friends with warm hearts and strong voices, he
mounted the platform and in stentorian tones
began a song from his own book. The sound
brought people from all the tents and cottages
around, and soon his meeting was in full blast,
with increasing numbers responding to his ardent
appeals. Word came to Dr. Vincent who speedily
marched into the arena. He walked upon the
platform, held up his hand in a gesture compelling
silence, and calling upon the self-appointed leader
by name, said:</p>

<p>"This meeting is not on the program, nor appointed
by the authorities, and it cannot be held."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>"What?" spoke up the praying-band commander.
"Do you mean to say that we can't have
a service of song and prayer on these grounds?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Dr. Vincent, "I do mean it.
No meeting of any kind can be held without the
order of the authorities. You should have come to
me for permission to hold this service."</p>

<p>The man was highly offended, gathered up his
books, and left the grounds on the next day. He
would have departed at once, but it was Sunday,
and the gates were closed. Let it be said, however,
that six months later, when he had thought it
over, he wrote to Dr. Vincent an ample apology
for his conduct and said that he had not realized
the difference between a camp meeting and a
Sunday School Assembly. He ended by an urgent
request that Dr. Vincent should come to the camp
ground at Round Lake, of which he was president,
should organize and conduct an assembly to be
an exact copy of Chautauqua in its program and
speakers, with all the resources of Round Lake at
his command. His invitation was accepted. In
due time, with this man's loyal support, Dr.
Vincent organized and set in motion the Round
Lake Assembly, upon the Chautauqua pattern,
which continues to this day, true to the ideals of
the founder.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>One unique institution on the Fair Point of those
early days must not be omitted&mdash;the Park of
Palestine. Following the suggestion of Dr. Vincent's
church lawn model of the Holy Land, Dr.
Wythe of Meadville, an adept in other trades
than physic and preaching, constructed just above
the pier on the lake shore a park one hundred and
twenty feet long, and seventy-five feet wide,
shaped to represent in a general way the contour
of the Holy Land. It was necessary to make the
elevations six times greater than longitudinal
measurements; and if one mountain is made six
times as large as it should be, some other hills less
prominent in the landscape or less important in
the record must be omitted. The lake was taken
to represent the Mediterranean Sea, and on the
Sea-Coast Plain were located the cities of the
Philistines, north of them Joppa and C&aelig;sarea,
and far beyond them on the shore, Tyre and Sidon.
The Mountain Region showed the famous places
of Israelite history from Beersheba to Dan, with
the sacred mountains Olivet and Zion, Ebal and
Gerizim having Jacob's Well beside them, Gilboa
with its memories of Gideon's victory and King
Saul's defeat, the mountain on whose crown our
Lord preached his sermon, and overtopping all,
Hermon, where he was transfigured. From two<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
springs flowed little rills to represent the sources
of the River Jordan which wound its way down the
valley, through the two lakes, Merom and the Sea
of Galilee, ending its course in the Dead Sea.
There were Jericho and the Brook Jabbok, the
clustered towns around the Galilean Sea, and at
the foot of Mount Hermon, C&aelig;sarea-Philippi.
Across the Jordan rose the Eastern Tableland,
with its mountains and valleys and brooks and
cities even as far as Damascus.</p>

<p>As the Assembly was an experiment, and might
be transferred later to other parts of the country,
the materials for this Palestine Park were somewhat
temporary. The mountains were made of
stumps, fragments of timber, filled in with sawdust
from a Mayville mill, and covered with grassy sods.
But the park constructed from makeshift materials
proved one of the most attractive features of the
encampment. Groups of Bible students might be
seen walking over it, notebooks in their hands,
studying the sacred places. A few would even
pluck and preserve a spear of grass, carefully enshrining
it in an envelope duly marked. A report
went abroad, indeed, that soil from the Holy Land
itself had been spread upon the park, constituting
it a sort of Campo Santo, but this claim was never
endorsed by either its architect or its originator.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
The park of Palestine still stands, having been rebuilt
several times, enlarged to a length of 350 feet, and
now, as I write, with another restoration promised.</p>

<p>One fact in this sacred geography must needs be
stated, in the interests of exact truth. In order
to make use of the lake shore, north had to be in
the south, and east in the west. Chautauqua has
always been under a despotic though paternal
government, and its visitors easily accommodate
themselves to its decrees. But the sun persists in
its independence, rises over Chautauqua's Mediterranean
Sea where it should set, and continues
its sunset over the mountains of Gilead, where it
should rise. Dr. Vincent and Lewis Miller could
bring to pass some remarkable, even seemingly
impossible, achievements, but they were not able
to outdo Joshua, and not only make the sun stand
still, but set it moving in a direction opposite to its
natural course.</p>

<p>In one of his inimitable speeches, Frank Beard
said that Palestine Park had been made the model
for all the beds on Fair Point. He slept, as he asserted,
on Palestine, with his head on Mount
Hermon, his body sometimes in the Jordan valley,
at other times on the mountains of Ephraim; and
one night when it rained, he found his feet in the
Dead Sea.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>In the early days of Chautauqua a tree was
standing near Palestine Park, which invited the
attention of every child, and many grown folks.
It was called "the spouting tree." Dr. Wythe
found a tree with one branch bent over near the
ground and hollow. He placed a water-pipe in the
branch and sent a current of fresh water through it,
so that the tree seemed to be pouring forth water.
At all times a troop of children might be seen
around it. At least one little girl made her father
walk down every day to the wonder, to the neglect
of other walks on the Assembly ground. Afterward
at home from an extended tour, they asked
her what was the most wonderful thing that she
had seen in her journey. They expected her to say,
"Niagara Falls," but without hesitation she answered,
"The tree that spouted water at Chautauqua."
The standards of greatness in the eyes of
childhood differ from those of the grown-up folks.</p>

<p>The true Chautauqua, aided as it was by the
features of mirth and entertainment and repartee,
was in the daily program followed diligently by the
assembled thousands. Here is in part the schedule,
taken from the printed report. It was opened on
Tuesday evening, August 4, 1874, in the out-of-doors
auditorium, now Miller Park, beginning with
a brief responsive service of Scripture and song,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
prepared by Dr. Vincent. Chautauqua clings to
ancient customs; and that same service, word for
word, has been rendered every year on the first
Tuesday evening in August, at what is known as
"Old First Night."</p>

<p>Bishop Vincent afterward wrote of that memorable
first meeting:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The stars were out, and looked down through
trembling leaves upon a goodly well-wrapped company,
who sat in the grove, filled with wonder and
hope. No electric light brought platform and people
face to face that night. The old-fashioned pine fires
on rude four-legged stands covered with earth, burned
with unsteady, flickering flame, now and then breaking
into brilliancy by the contact of a resinous stick
of the rustic fireman, who knew how to snuff candles
and how to turn light on the crowd of campers-out.
The white tents around the enclosure were very beautiful
in that evening light.</p></div>

<p>At this formal opening on August 4, 1874, brief
addresses were given by Dr. Vincent and by a
Baptist, a Presbyterian, a Methodist, and a Congregational
pastor. This opening showed the
broad brotherhood which was to mark the history
of Chautauqua.</p>

<p>On the next day, Wednesday, began what might
be called the school sessions of the Assembly. The
fourteen days were divided into three terms.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
Every morning at 8 o'clock a brief service of prayer
and Bible reading began the day in the auditorium,
now Miller Park. At 8:15 during the first term,
August 4th-9th, a conference was held of Normal
Class and Institute conductors, at which reports
were rendered of work done, courses of study, and
methods of work, and results obtained. In those
days when training classes for Sunday School
teachers were almost unknown, this series of conferences,
attended by hundreds of workers, proved
of infinite value, and set in motion classes in many
places. At 9 o'clock, section meetings were held
for superintendents and pastors, and teachers of
the different grades, from the primary class to the
adult Bible class.</p>

<p>The Normal Class held its sessions during the
second term, from August 10th-13th, and the third
term, August 14th-18th. Four classes were held
simultaneously in different tents, with teachers
changed each day. At these classes most of the
lessons were on the Bible&mdash;its Evidences, Books and
Authors, Geography, History, and Interpretation.
The topics pertaining to the teacher and the class
were taken up in the different conferences. The
Normal Class was held to be the core and life of the
Assembly, and everybody was urged to attend its
sessions. All whose names began with letters from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
A to G were to attend regularly Tent A. Those
with initials from H to M were to go to Tent B,
and so on through the alphabet, to the four Normal
Tents. But the students soon found their favorite
teachers, would watch for them, and follow them
into their different tents. There was another infraction
of the program. The blackboard was a
new feature in Sunday School work, and not
enough blackboards of good quality had been
secured. Some were too small, some were not black
enough, and one was painted with the lines for
music. It is reported that some of the teachers
bribed the janitor to provide for their use the good
boards. There is even the tale that a Sunday
School leader was seen stealing a blackboard and
replacing it in another's tent by an inferior one.
We humbly trust that this report was false.</p>

<p>That the Normal Class, the conferences, and the
lectures on Sunday School work were taken seriously
is shown by the report of the written examination,
held on Monday, August 17th, the day before
the Assembly closed. More than two hundred
people sat down in the Tabernacle on the hill,
each furnished with fifty questions on the Bible
and the Sunday School. Twenty or more dropped
out, but at the end of the nearly five hours' wrestling
one hundred and eighty-four papers were handed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
in. Three of these were marked absolutely perfect,
those of the Rev. C. P. Hard, on his way to
India as a missionary, Mr. Caleb Sadler of Iowa,
and the Rev. Samuel McGerald of New York.
Ninety-two were excellent, fifty more were passed,
making one hundred and forty-five accepted
members of the Normal Alumni Association;
eighteen had their papers returned to be rewritten
after further study, and the lowest fourteen were
consigned to the wastebasket.</p>

<p>The <i>Western Christian Advocate</i> gave a picture
of the first normal examination at Chautauqua,
which we republish.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The tent is a very large one, and was plentifully supplied
with benches, chairs, camp-stools, etc. The
spectacle was very imposing. The ladies seemed a
little in the majority. There were two girls under
fifteen, and one boy in his fourteenth year. Each was
provided with paper, and each wore a more or less
silent and thoughtful air. There was no shuffling, no
listlessness, no whispering. The conductor, with a
big stump for his table, occupied a somewhat central
position, ready to respond to the call of any uplifted
hand. We stood just back of Dr. Vincent, with the
scene in full view. To our right, but a little on the
outside of the tent, were Bishop Simpson and Dr.
Thomas M. Eddy, who remained only a few minutes,
as the latter was compelled to take the ten o'clock
train for New York. On the same side, and a little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
nearer to us, were groups of visitors, mostly from the
country adjacent, who gazed in rapt astonishment at
the sight before them, not daring to inquire the meaning
of all this mute array of paper and pencil. A little
to our left was a lawyer of large experience and almost
national fame, who had removed his hat, collar, coat
and cuffs; just by his side was an ex-State senator;
and a little further on was a boy from Iowa. He had
improvised for his table a small round log, and had
gathered together for the better resting of his knees, a
good-sized pile of dry beech-leaves. This lad, we
learned, had been studying the Normal course during
the last year; and we further discovered that he succeeded
in answering accurately all but ten or twelve of
the fifty questions, one of the to him insoluble and
incomprehensible being, "What is the relation of the
church to the Sunday School?" Nearly in front
of the conductor were two veteran spectacled sisters,
who at no time whispered to each other, but kept up a
strong thinking and a frequent use of the pencil.
Near these sat a mother and daughter from Evanston,
Illinois, silent and confident. On the outer row of
seats we observed three doctors of divinity, a theological
student, the president of an Ohio college, a
gentleman connected with the internal revenue, and
a lady principal of a young ladies' seminary, all with
their thinking-caps admirably adjusted.</p>

<p>At the end of an hour and forty minutes a New
York brother, who had been especially active in
sectional work, held up his hand in token of success,
and his paper was passed up to Dr. Vincent. Shortly
afterward another made a similar signal; but nearly all
occupied over three hours in the work. Over one half
attained to seventy-five or eighty per cent.</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>Let it be remembered that no matter how long
the student was compelled to remain, even long
past the dinner hour, he was not permitted to take
a recess for his midday meal. He must stay to the
end, or give up his examination.</p>

<p>The report of the Assembly shows twenty-two
lectures on Sunday School work, theory, and practice;
sectional meetings&mdash;nine primary, six intermediate,
one senior, five of pastors and superintendents,
eight normal class and institute conductors'
conferences; six Normal Classes in each
of the four tents&mdash;twenty-four in all; three teachers'
meetings for preparation of the Sunday School
lesson; four Bible readings; three praise services;
two children's meetings; and six sermons. All the
leading Protestant churches were represented; and
twenty-five States in the Union, besides Ontario,
Montreal, Nova Scotia, Ireland, Scotland, and
India. Among the preachers we find the names of
Dr. H. Clay Trumbull, editor of the <i>Sunday School
Times</i>, John B. Gough, Bishops Simpson and
Janes, Dr. James M. Buckley, Dr. Charles F.
Deems, Dr. T. DeWitt Talmage, and four ministers
who later became bishops in the Methodist
Episcopal Church:&mdash;Drs. H. W. Warren, J. F.
Hurst, E. O. Haven, and C. H. Fowler.</p>

<p>The two Sundays, August 9th and 16th, were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
golden days in the calendar. An atmosphere of
quiet and peace reigned throughout the grounds.
No steamboats made the air discordant around the
pier; the gates were closed and the steamers sailed
by to more welcome stations; no excursion trains
brought curious and noisy throngs of sightseers.
Tents and cottages lay open while their dwellers
worshiped under the trees of the Auditorium, for
no one was required to watch against thieves in the
crowd. The world was shut out, and a voice
seemed to be saying, "Come ye yourselves apart
and rest awhile."</p>

<p>The day began with a Sunday School graded to
embrace both young and old. The riches of officers
and teachers formed an embarrassment. For once,
nay twice (for there were two Sundays), a Superintendent
had at call more instructors than he
could supply with classes. On each Sunday the
attendance at the school was fifteen hundred.</p>

<p>At the sunset hour each evening an "Eventide
Conference" was held on the lake side. The dying
day, the peaceful surroundings, the calm sheet of
water, the mild air, combined to impart a tone of
thoughtful, uplifting meditation. I have heard old
Chautauquans speak many times of the inspiring
spiritual atmosphere breathed in the very air of
the first Chautauqua.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>Never before had been brought together for
conference and for study so many leaders in the
Sunday School army, representing so large a
variety of branches in the church catholic. And it
was not for a day or two days as in conventions
and institutes, but for a solid fortnight of steady
work. The Chautauqua of to-day is a widely
reaching educational system, embracing almost
every department of knowledge. But it must not
be forgotten that all this wide realm has grown out
of a school to awaken, instruct, and inspire Sunday
School workers. In their conception, however, the
two famous founders realized that all truth, even
that looked upon as secular, is subsidiary, even
necessary for successful teaching of the word of
God. Hence with the courses of study and conferences
upon practical details, we find on the
program, some literature and science, with the
spice of entertainment and amusement.</p>

<p>The conception of Dr. Vincent was not to locate
the Assembly in one place, but from time to time
to hold similar meetings on many camp grounds,
wherever the opportunity arose. There is a suspicion
that Lewis Miller held his own secret purpose
to make it so successful on Chautauqua Lake
as to insure its permanent location at Fair Point.
That was a wise plan, for with settlement in one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
place, buildings could be erected, and features
like Palestine Park could be increased and improved.
Whether it was by a suggestion or a
common impulse, on the last day of the Assembly
a meeting was held and a unanimous appeal was
presented to make Fair Point the home of the
Assembly. The trustees of the camp meeting
shared in the sentiment and offered to receive new
members representing the Assembly constituency.
As a result, the officiary was reorganized, no longer
as a camp meeting but as an Assembly Board.
For two years Fair Point was continued as the
name of the Post Office, although the title "Chautauqua
Sunday School Assembly" was adopted.
But soon Fair Point became "Chautauqua" on
the list of the Post Office Department, and the old
name lingers only in the memory of old Chautauquans.</p>

<p>Before we leave that pioneer Chautauqua, we
must recall some of its aspects, which might be
forgotten in these later days, at once amusing,
perplexing, and sometimes trying. More steamers,
great and small, were plying Chautauqua's waters
than at the present under the steamboat corporation
system. Old Chautauquans will remember
that ancient three-decker, <i>The Jamestown</i>, with its
pair of stern wheels, labeled respectively "Vincent"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
and "Miller." Each steamer was captained by its
owner; and there was often a congestion of boats
at the pier, especially after the arrival of an excursion
train. Those were not the days of standard
time, eastern and central, with watches set an hour
fast or slow at certain well-known points. Each
boat followed its own standard of time, which
might be New York time, Buffalo or Pittsburgh
time, forty minutes slower, or even Columbus or
Cincinnati time, slower still. Railroads crossing
Ohio were required to run on Columbus time.
When you were selecting a steamer from the thirty
placards on the bulletin board at the Fair Point
Post office, in order to meet an Erie train at Lakewood,
unless you noticed the time-standard, you
might find at the pier that your steamer had gone
forty minutes before, or on arriving at Lakewood
learn that your boat was running on Cincinnati
time, and you were three quarters of an hour late
for the train, for even on the Erie of those days,
trains were not <i>always</i> an hour behind time.</p>

<p>Nor was this variety of "time, times, and half-time"
all the drawbacks. When news came that
an excursion train was due from Buffalo, every
steamboat on the lake would ignore its time-table
and the needs of the travelers; and all would
be bunched at the Mayville dock and around it to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
catch the passengers. Or it might be a similar but
more tangled crowd of boats in the Outlet at Jamestown
to meet a special train from Pittsburgh.
Haven't I seen a bishop on the Fair Point pier, who
<i>must</i> get the train at Lakewood to meet his conference
in Colorado, scanning the landscape with
not a boat in sight, all piled up three miles away?</p>

<p>Nor were the arrangements for freight and
baggage in those early years any more systematic
than those for transportation. Although Chautauqua
Lake is on the direct line of travel east and
west, between New York and Chicago, and north
and south between Buffalo and Pittsburgh, Fair
Point, the seat of the Assembly, was not a railroad
station. Luggage could be checked only to Jamestown,
Lakewood, or Mayville, and thence must be
sent by boat. Its destination might be indicated
by a tag or a chalk mark, or it might remain unmarked.
Imagine a steamer deck piled high with
trunks, valises, bundles of blankets, furniture,
tent equipment, and things miscellaneous, stopping
at a dozen points along the lake to have its cargo
assorted and put ashore&mdash;is it strange that some
baggage was left at the wrong place, and its owner
wandered around looking vainly for his property?
One man remarked that the only way to be sure
of your trunk was to sit on it; but what if your<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
trunk was on the top or at the bottom of a pile
ten feet high? Considering all the difficulties and
discomforts of those early days&mdash;travel, baggage,
no hotels nor boarding houses, a crowded dining
hall with a hungry procession outside perhaps in
the rain waiting for seats at the tables, the food
itself none of the best&mdash;it is surprising that some
thousands of people not only found the Assembly,
but stayed to its conclusion, were happy in it,
lived in an enchanted land for a fortnight, and
resolved to return the very next year! More than
this, they carried its enthusiasm and its ideals
home with them and in hundreds of places far
apart, the Sunday Schools began to assume a new
and higher life. Some time after this, but still
early in Chautauqua's history, a prominent Sunday
School man expressed to the writer his opinion
that "people who came home from Chautauqua
became either a mighty help or a mighty nuisance.
They brought with them more new ideas than
could be put into operation in ten years; and if
they couldn't get them, one and all, adopted at
once they kicked and growled incessantly."</p>

<p>Before we leave the Assembly of 1874, we must
not forget to name one of its most powerful and
far-reaching results&mdash;the Woman's Christian Temperance
Union. This assembly was held soon after<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
the great crusade of 1874 in Ohio, when multitudes
of women, holding prayer meetings on the sidewalk
in front of liquor saloons literally prayed thousands
of them out of existence. While the fire of the
crusade was still burning, a number of women held
meetings at Chautauqua during the Assembly, and
took counsel together concerning the best measures
to promote the temperance reform. They united
in a call signed by Mrs. Mattie McClellan Brown,
Mrs. Jennie Fowler Willing, Mrs. Emily Huntington
Miller, and others, for a convention of women
to be held in Cleveland, Ohio, November 17, 1874.
At this convention, sixteen States were represented,
and the national Woman's Christian Temperance
Union was organized, an institution which
did more than any other to form public sentiment,
to make State after State "dry," and finally to
establish nation-wide constitutional prohibition.
It may not be generally known that this mighty
movement began at the first Chautauqua Assembly.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<h3>THE EARLY DEVELOPMENT</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Chautauqua</span> was a lusty infant when it entered
upon life in 1874, and it began with a penetrating
voice, heard afar. Like all normal babies (normal
seems to be the right word just here) it began to
grow, and its progress in the forty-seven years of
its life thus far (1920) has been the growth of a
giant. Territorially, on Chautauqua Lake, it has
enlarged at successive stages from twenty acres
to more than three hundred and thirty acres,
impelled partly by a demand of its increasing
family for house-room, educational facilities, and
playgrounds, partly from the necessity of controlling
its surroundings to prevent occupation by
undesirable neighbors. There has been another
vast expansion in the establishment of Chautauquas
elsewhere, until the continent is now dotted
with them. A competent authority informs the
writer that within twelve months ten thousand
assemblies bearing the generic name Chautauqua
have been held in the United States and the Dominion<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
of Canada. There has been a third growth in
the intellectual sweep of its plans. We have seen
how it began as a system of training for teachers
in the Sunday School. We shall trace its advancement
into the wider field of general and universal
education, a school in every department and for
everybody everywhere.</p>

<p>To at least one pilgrim the Assembly of 1875
was monumental, for it marked an epoch in his
life. That was the writer of this volume, who in
that year made his first visit to Chautauqua.
(The general reader who has no interest in personal
reminiscences may omit this paragraph.) He
traveled by the Erie Railroad, and that evening
for the first time in his life saw a berth made up in a
sleeping-car, and crawled into it. If in his dreams
that night, a vision could have flashed upon his
inward eye of what that journey was to bring to
him in the coming years, he might have deemed it
an Arabian Night's dream. For that visit to Chautauqua,
not suddenly but in the after years,
changed the entire course of his career. It sent
him to Chautauqua thus far for forty-six successive
seasons, and perhaps may round him out in a semi-centennial.
It took him out of a parsonage, and
made him an itinerant on a continent-wide scale.
It put him into Dr. Vincent's office as an assistant,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
and later in his chair as his successor. It dropped
him down through the years at Chautauqua
assemblies in almost half of the States of this
Union. On Tuesday morning, August 3, 1875, I
left the train at Jamestown, rode across the city,
and embarked in a steamer for a voyage up the
lake. As we slowly wound our way through the
Outlet&mdash;it was on the old steamer <i>Jamestown</i>
which was never an ocean-greyhound&mdash;I felt like
an explorer in some unknown river. Over the old
pier at Fair Point was the sign, "National S. S.
Assembly," and beneath it I stepped ashore on
what seemed almost a holy ground, for my first
walk was through Palestine Park. On Friday,
August 6th, I gave a normal lesson, the first in my
life, with fear and trembling. It was on "the city
of Jerusalem," and I had practiced on the map
until I thought that I could draw it without a copy.
But, alas, one of the class must needs come to the
blackboard and set my askew diagram in the right
relations. Twenty years afterward, at an assembly
in Kansas, an old lady spoke to me after a lesson,
"I saw you teach your first lesson at Chautauqua.
You said that you had never taught a normal class
before, and I thought it was the solemn truth.
You've improved since then!"</p>

<p>Some new features had been added to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
grounds since the first Assembly. Near Palestine
Park was standing a fine model of modern Jerusalem
and its surrounding hills, so exact in its
reproduction that one day a bishop pointed out the
identical building wherein he had lodged when
visiting the city&mdash;the same hostel, by the way,
where this writer stayed afterward in 1897, and
from whose roof he took his first view of the holy
places. Near Palestine Park, an oriental house
had been constructed, with rooms in two stories
around an open court. These rooms were filled
with oriental and arch&aelig;ological curiosities, making
it a museum; and every day Dr. A. O. Von Lennep,
a Syrian by birth, stood on its roof and gave in
Arabic the Mohammedan call to prayer. I failed
to observe, however, the people at Chautauqua
prostrating themselves at the summons. Indeed,
some of them actually mocked the make-believe
muezzin before his face. On the hill, near the
Dining Hall, stood a sectional model of the great
pyramid, done in lath and plaster, as if sliced in
two from the top downward, half of it being shown,
and the room inside of it indicated. Also there was
a model of the Tabernacle in the Wilderness,
covered with its three curtains, and containing
within an altar, table, and candlestick. Daily
lectures were given before it by the Rev. J. S.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
Ostrander, wearing the miter, robe, and breastplate
of the high priest.</p>

<p>The evolution of the Chautauqua Idea made
some progress at the second Assembly. Instead of
eight sessions of the Normal Class, two were held
daily. The program report says that fifty normal
sessions were held; regularly two each day, one at
8 o'clock in the morning on a Bible topic. Breakfast
must be rushed through at seven to brace up
the students for their class. Another was held at
3:30, on some subject pertaining to the pupil or
the teacher; with extra sessions in order to complete
the specified course. A class in Hebrew was
held daily by Dr. S. M. Vail, and attended by forty
students. Dr. Vail had been for many years professor
of Hebrew in the earliest Methodist theological
school, the Biblical Institute at Concord,
New Hampshire, which afterward became the
School of Theology in Boston University. Dr.
Vail was an enthusiast in his love of Hebrew
language and literature. One who occupied a tent
with him&mdash;all the workers of that season were
lodged in a row of little tents on Terrace Avenue,
two in each tent&mdash;averred that his trunk contained
only a Hebrew Bible (he didn't need a lexicon)
and a clean shirt.</p>

<p>Besides the class in Hebrew, Madame Kriege of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
New York conducted a class in kindergarten
teaching, and Dr. Tourjee of Boston, W. F. Sherwin,
and C. C. Case held classes in singing. All
these were supposedly for Sunday School teachers,
but they proved to be the thin end of the wedge
opening the way for the coming summer school.</p>

<p>Even more strongly than at the earlier session,
the Normal Class, with a systematic course of
instruction in the Bible and Sunday School work,
was made the center of the program. It is significant
of the importance assigned to this department
that for several years, no other meeting, great or
small, was permitted at the normal hours. The camp
must either attend the classes or stay in its tents.</p>

<p>At this session, Mrs. Frank Beard, noting the
insistent announcement of the Normal Classes, and
the persistent urging that everybody attend them,
was moved to verse. As true poetry is precious, her
effusion is here given:</p>

<div class='poem'>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To Chautauqua went</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">On pleasure bent</span><br />
A youth and maiden fair.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Working in the convention</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Was not their intention,</span><br />
But to drive away dull care.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Along came John V&mdash;&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And what did he see</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>But this lover and his lass.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Says he, "You must</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Get up and dust</span><br />
And go to the Normal Class."<br />
</div>

<p>The great event in the Assembly of '75 was the
visit of General U. S. Grant, then President of the
United States on his second term. It was brought
about partly because of the long-time friendship
of the General with Dr. Vincent, dating back to
the Galena pastorate of 1860 and '61, but also
through the influence and activity of the Rev. Dr.
Theodore L. Flood, who though a successful
Methodist minister was also somewhat of a politician.
The President and his party came up from
Jamestown on a steamer-yacht, and at Fair Point
were lodged in the tent beside the Lewis Miller
cottage. True to his rule while General and
President, Grant made no speech in public, not
even when a handsomely bound Bagster Bible
was presented to him in behalf of the assembly.
Those were the palmy days of "Teachers' Bibles,"
with all sorts of helps and tables as appendices;
and at that time the Bagster and the American
Tract Society were rivals for the Sunday School
constituency. Not to be outdone by their competitors,
the Tract Society's representative at
Chautauqua also presented one of his Bibles to
the President. One can scarcely have too many<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
Bibles, and the General may have found use for
both of them. He received them with a nod but
never a word. Yet those who met him at dinners
and in social life said that in private he was a delightful
talker and by no means reticent. The
tents and cottages on the Chautauqua of those
days were taxed to almost bursting capacity to
house the multitude over the Sunday of the President's
visit. As many more would have come on
that day, if the rules concerning Sabbath observance
had been relaxed, as some had expected.
But the authorities were firm, the gates by lake
and land were kept closed, and that Sunday was
like all other Sundays at Chautauqua.</p>

<span class="caption">Spouting Tree and Oriental House</span>
</div>

<p>At the close of the Assembly, the normal examinations
were given to 190 students; some left the
tent in terror after reading over the questions, but
130 struggled to the end and handed in their
papers, of which 123 were above the passing grade.
There were now two classes of graduates, and the
Chautauqua Normal Alumni Association was
organized. Mr. Otis F. Presbrey of Washington,
D. C. (the man who on a certain occasion "looked
like sixty"), was its first president. The secretary
chosen was the Rev. J. A. Worden, a Presbyterian
pastor at Steubenville, Ohio, and one of the normal
teachers at Chautauqua; who afterward, and for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
many years, was general secretary and superintendent
of Sabbath School work in the Presbyterian
Church.</p>

<p>At the Assembly of 1875, a quiet, unassuming
little lady was present, who was already famous,
and helped to increase the fame of Chautauqua.
This was Mrs. G. R. Alden, the wife of a Presbyterian
pastor, but known everywhere as "Pansy,"
whose story-books were in almost every Sunday
School library on the continent. She wrote a
book, <i>Four Girls at Chautauqua</i>, which ingeniously
wove into the account of the actual events of the
season, including some of its rainy days&mdash;that
was the year when it rained more or less on fourteen
of the seventeen days of the Assembly&mdash;her
four girls, so well imagined that they seemed real.
Indeed when one read the account of one's own
speech at a children's meeting, he could not doubt
that the Flossie of the story who listened to it
was a veritable flesh and blood girl in the audience.
The story became one of the most popular of the
Pansy books, brought Chautauqua to the attention
of many thousands, and led large numbers of
people to Fair Point. Pansy has ever been a true
friend of Chautauqua, and has written several
stories setting forth its attractions.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<h3>THE NATIONAL CENTENNIAL YEAR</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> founders of Chautauqua looked forward to
its third session with mingled interest and anxiety.
It was the centennial year of American Independence,
and an exposition was opening in Philadelphia,
far more noteworthy in its buildings and
exhibits than any previous effort in the annals of
the nation. The World's Fair in the Crystal
Palace of New York, in 1855, the first attempt
in America to hold an universal exposition, was a
pigmy compared with the immense display in the
park of Philadelphia on the centennial year.
Could the multitudes from every State and from
foreign lands be attracted from Philadelphia five
hundred miles to Chautauqua Lake? Had the
quest of the American people for new interests
been satisfied by two years at the Assembly?
Would it be the wiser course in view of the competition
to hold merely a modest little gathering
at Fair Point, or to venture boldly upon greater
endeavors than ever before; to enlarge the program,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
to advertise more widely, and to compel
attention to the new movement? Anyone who
knew the adventurous, aspiring nature of both
Miller and Vincent would unhesitatingly answer
these questions.</p>

<p>The Assembly of 1876 was planned upon a larger
scale than ever before. The formal opening took
place on Tuesday evening, August 1st, in the
forest-sheltered Auditorium, but two gatherings
were held in advance and a third after its conclusion,
so that the entire program embraced twenty-four
days instead of seventeen.</p>

<p>The first meeting was the Scientific Conference,
July 26th to 28th, aiming both to present science
from the Christian point of view, and Christianity
from the scientific point of view, showing the
essential harmony between them, without either
subjecting conclusions of science to church-authority
or cutting up the Bible at the behest of
the scientists. There had been frequent battles
between the theologians and the students of nature
and the "conflict of science and religion" had been
strongly in evidence, ever since the publication of
Darwin's <i>Origin of Species</i> in 1859. Most pulpits
had uttered their thunders against "Darwinism,"
even though some of the pulpiteers had never read
Darwin's book, nor could have understood it if they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
had tried. And many professors who had never
listened to a gospel sermon, and rarely opened their
Bibles, had launched lightnings at the camp of the
theologians. But here was something new; a
company of scholars including Dr. R. Ogden
Doremus of New York, Professor A. S. Lattimore
of Rochester, Dr. Alexander Winchell of Michigan,
and others of equal standing, on the same platform
with eminent preachers, and no restraint on either
side, each free to utter his convictions, and all
certain that the outcome would be peace and not
war.</p>

<p>The writer of these pages was present at most
of those lectures, and remembers one instance
showing that the province of science is in the past
and the present and not in the future. Dr. Doremus
was giving some brilliant experiments in the
newer developments of electricity. Be it remembered
that it was the year 1876, and in the Centennial
Exposition of that year there was neither
an automobile, a trolley-car, nor an electric light.
He said, "I will now show you that remarkable
phenomenon&mdash;the electric light. Be careful not
to gaze at it too steadily, for it is apt to dazzle
the beholder and may injure the eyesight." Then
as an arc-light of a crude sort flashed and sputtered,
and fell and rose again only to sputter and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
fall, the lecturer said, "Of course, the electric
light is only an interesting experiment, a sort of
toy to amuse spectators. Every effort to <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'ulitize'">utilize</ins> it
has failed, and always will fail. The electric light
in all probability will never be of any practical value."</p>

<p>Yet at that very time, Thomas A. Edison in
Menlo Park, New Jersey, was perfecting his
incandescent light, and only three years later,
1879, Chautauqua was illuminated throughout
by electricity. When the scientist turns prophet
he becomes as fallible as the preacher who assumes
to prescribe limitations to scientific discovery.
We live in an age of harmony and mutual helpfulness
between science and religion; and Chautauqua
has wrought mightily in bringing to pass the new
day.</p>

<p>It is worthy of mention that Chautauqua holds a
connecting link with "the wizard of Llewellyn
Park" and his electric light; for some years later
Mr. Edison married Miss Mina Miller, daughter
of the Founder Lewis Miller. The Miller family,
Founder, sons, daughters, and grandchildren, have
maintained a deep interest in Chautauqua; and
the Swiss Cottage at the head of Miller Park has
every year been occupied. Representatives of the
Miller family are always members of the Board
of Trustees.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>After the Scientific Conference came a Temperance
Congress, on July 29th and 30th. A new
star had arisen in the firmament. Out of a little
meeting at Chautauqua in 1874, had grown the
Woman's Christian Temperance Union, already in
1876 organized in every State and in pretty nearly
every town. Its founders had chosen for President
of the Union a young woman who combined in one
personality the consummate orator and the wise
executive, Miss Frances Elizabeth Willard of
Evanston, Illinois, who resigned her post as Dean
of the Woman's Department of the Northwestern
University to enter upon an arduous, a lifelong
and world-wide warfare to prohibit intoxicants,
and as a means to that end, to obtain the suffrage
for women. Frances Willard died in 1898, but if
she could have lived until 1920 she would have seen
both her aims accomplished in the eighteenth and
nineteenth amendments to the Constitution of the
United States; one forbidding the manufacture and
sale of all <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'alchoholic'">alcoholic</ins> liquors, the other opening the
door of the voting-booth to every woman in the
land. In Statuary Hall, Washington, the only woman
standing in marble is Frances E. Willard (there
will be others later), and her figure is there among
the statesmen and warriors of the nation's history,
by vote of the Legislature of the State of Illinois.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>At every step in the progress of Chautauqua the
two Founders held frequent consultations. Both
of them belonged to the progressive school of
thought, but on some details they differed, and
woman's sphere was one of their points of disagreement.
Miller favored women on the Fair
Point platform, but Vincent was in doubt on the
subject. Of course some gifted women came as
teachers of teachers in the primary department of
the Sunday School, but on the program their
appearance was styled a "Reception to Primary
Teachers by Mrs. or Miss So-and-So." Dr.
Vincent knew Frances E. Willard, admired her,
believed honestly that she was one of the very
small number of women called to speak in public,
and he consented to her coming to Chautauqua in
the Temperance Congress of 1876. From the hour
of her first appearance there was never after any
doubt as to her enthusiastic welcome at Chautauqua.
No orator drew larger audiences or bound
them under a stronger spell by eloquent words
than did Frances Elizabeth Willard. Frances
Willard was the first but by no means the last
woman to lecture on the Chautauqua platform.
Mrs. Mary A. Livermore soon followed her, and
before many summers had passed, Dr. Vincent
was introducing to the Chautauqua constituency<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
women as freely as men, to speak on the questions
of the time.</p>

<p>Another innovation began on this centennial
season&mdash;<i>The Chautauqua Assembly Herald</i>. For
two years the Assembly had been dependent
upon reports by newspaper correspondents, who
came to the ground as strangers, with no share
in the Chautauqua spirit, knowing very little of
Chautauqua's aims, and eager for striking paragraphs
rather than accurate records. A lecturer
who is wise never reads the report of his speech in
the current newspapers; for he is apt to tear his
hair in anguish at the tale of his utterances.
Chautauqua needed an organ, and Dr. Theodore
L. Flood, from the first a staunch friend
of the movement, undertook to establish a daily
paper for the season. The first number of the
<i>Herald</i> appeared on June 29, 1876, with Dr.
Flood as editor, and Mr. Milton Bailey of Jamestown
as publisher. The opening number was
published in advance of the Assembly and sent to
Chautauquans everywhere; but the regular issue
began on July 29th with the Scientific Conference,
and was continued daily (except Sunday) until the
close of the Assembly. Every morning sleepers
(who ought to have arisen earlier in time for morning
prayers at 6:40) were awakened by the shrill<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
voices of boys calling out "<i>Daily Assembly Herald!</i>"
The <i>Daily</i> was a success from the start, for it
contained accurate and complete reports of the
most important lectures, outlines of the Normal
lessons, and the items of information needed by
everybody. All over the land people who could
not come to Chautauqua kept in touch with its
life through the <i>Herald</i>. More than one distinguished
journalist began his editorial career in
the humble quarters of <i>The Chautauqua Daily
Assembly Herald</i>. For two seasons the <i>Daily</i> was
printed in Mayville, though edited on the ground.
In 1878 a printing plant was established at the
Assembly and later became the Chautauqua Press.
Almost a generation after its establishment, its
name was changed to <i>The Chautauquan Daily</i>,
which throughout the year is continued as <i>The
Chautauquan Weekly</i>, with news of the Chautauqua
movement at home and abroad.</p>

<p>Visitors to Chautauqua in the centennial year
beheld for the first time a structure which won
fame from its inhabitants if not from its architecture.
This was the Guest House, standing
originally on the lake shore near the site of the
present Men's Club building; though nobody
remembers it by its official name, for it soon became
known as "The Ark." No, gentle reader, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
report is without foundation that this was the
original vessel in which Noah traveled with his
menagerie, and that after reposing on Mount
Ararat it went adrift on Lake Chautauqua.
"The Ark" was built to provide a comfortable
home for the speakers and workers at the Assembly
who for two years had been lodged in tents, like
the Israelites in the Wilderness. It was a frame
building of two stories, shingle-roofed, with external
walls and internal partitions of tent-cloth.
Each room opened upon a balcony, the stairs to the
upper floor being on the outside and the entire
front of each cell a curtain, which under a strong
wind was wont to break loose, regardless of the
condition of the people inside. After a few years a
partition between two rooms at one end was taken
down, a chimney and fireplace built, and the result
was a living room where the arkites assembled
around a fire and told stories. Ah, those <i>noctes
ambrosian&aelig;</i> when Edward Everett Hale and
Charles Barnard and Sherwin and the Beards
narrated yarns and cracked jokes! Through the
thin partitions of the bedrooms, every sneeze
could be heard. The building was soon dubbed
Noah's Ark, then "Knowers' Ark," from the varied
learning of its indwellers; and sometimes from the
reverberations sounding at night, "Snorers' Ark."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
Frank Beard was a little deaf, and was wont to sit
at these <i>conversazioni</i> in the parlor of the Ark
with his hand held like an ear-trumpet. Mrs.
Beard used to say that whenever she wished to
hold a private conversation with him, they hired
a boat and rowed out at least a mile from the
shore. When the Assembly enlarged its boundaries
by a purchase of land, the Ark was moved up
to higher ground in the forest near where the Normal
Hall now stands, and there served almost a
generation of Chautauqua workers, until its frail
materials were in danger of collapse, and it was
taken down. Less famous buildings have been
kept in memory by tablets and monuments; but it
would require no small slab of marble to contain
the names of the famous men and women who
dwelt in that old Guest House; and what a book
might have been made if some Boswell had kept
the record of its stories and sayings! After spending
two nights in the Ark, the Rev. Alfred Taylor's
poetic muse was aroused to sing of the place and
its occupants after this fashion:</p>

<div class='poem'>
This structure of timber and muslin contained<br />
Of preachers and teachers some two or three score;<br />
Of editors, parsons a dozen or more.<br />
There were Methodists, Baptists, and 'Piscopals, too<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>And grave Presbyterians, a handful or two.<br />
There were lawyers, and doctors and various folks,<br />
All full of their wisdom, and full of their jokes.<br />
There were writers of lessons, and makers of songs,<br />
And shrewd commentators with wonderful tongues;<br />
And all of these busy, industrious men<br />
Found it hard to stop talking at just half-past ten.<br />
They talked, and they joked, and they kept such a clatter<br />
That neighboring folks wondered what was the matter<br />
But weary at last, they extinguished the light,<br />
And went to their beds for the rest of the night.<br />
</div>

<p>The formal opening of the Assembly in 1876
took place after the Scientific and Temperance
gatherings, on Tuesday evening, August 1st, in
the leaf-roofed Auditorium, but the benches were
now provided with backs for the comfort of the
thousands. The platform had been enlarged to
make room for a choir, under the leadership in turn
of W. F. Sherwin and Philip P. Bliss, whose gospel
songs are still sung around the world. Only a
few months later, that voice was hushed forever
on earth, when the train bearing the singer and his
wife crashed through a broken bridge at Ashtabula,
Ohio. The record of that evening shows that
fifteen speakers gave greetings, supposedly five
minutes in length, although occasionally the
flow of language overpassed the limit. Among the
speakers we read the names of Dr. Henry M. Sanders<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
of New York, Mr. John D. Wattles of the
<i>Sunday School Times</i>, Dr. Henry W. Warren of
Philadelphia, soon to become a bishop in the
Methodist Episcopal Church, Dr. C. F. Burr,
the author of <i>Ecce C&oelig;lum</i>, a book of astronomy
ministering to religion, famous in that day, though
almost forgotten in our time; Dr. Lyman Abbott,
who came before the audience holding up his
pocket-Bible, with the words, "I am here to-night,
because here this book is held in honor," Dr.
Warren Randolph, the head of Sunday School
work among the Baptist churches, and Mr. A. O.
Van Lennep, in Syrian costume and fez-cap. He
made two speeches, one in Arabic, the other in
English.</p>

<p>Normal work for Sunday School teachers was
kept well in the foreground. The subjects of the
course were divided into departments, each under
a director, who chose his assistants. Four simultaneous
lessons were given in the section tents,
reviewed later in the day by the directors at a
meeting of all the classes in the pavilion. In
addition, Dr. Vincent held four public platform
reviews, covering the entire course. The record
states that about five hundred students were
present daily in the Normal department. About
one hundred undertook the final examinations for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
membership in the Normal Alumni Association.
The writer of these pages well remembers those
hours in the pavilion, for he was one of those
examined, and Frank Beard was another. The
first question on the paper was, "What is your
name and address?" Mr. Beard remarked
audibly, that he was glad he could answer at least
one of the questions. To dispel the doubts of our
readers, we remark that both of us passed, and
were duly enrolled among the Normal Alumni.</p>

<p>The list of the lecturers and their subjects show
that Bible study and Bible teaching still stood at
the fore. The program contained with many
others the following names: Dr. W. E. Knox on
"The Old Testament Severities," Dr. Lyman
Abbott, "Bible Interpretation," Dr. R. K. Hargrove
of Tennessee, later a bishop in the Methodist
Episcopal Church, South, "Childhood and the
Sunday School Work," Dr. George P. Hays,
then President of Washington and Jefferson
College, "How to Reason," Frank Beard, a caricature
lecture with crayon on "Our School," showing
types of teachers and scholars, Dr. George
W. Woodruff, a most entertaining lecture on
"Bright Days in Foreign Lands," Dr. A. J. Baird
of Tennessee, "Going Fishing with Peter," Rev.
J. A. Worden, "What a Presbyterian Thinks of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
John Wesley,"&mdash;a response to Rev. J. L. Hurlbut's
lecture in 1875 on "What a Methodist Thinks of
John Knox,"&mdash;Prof. L. T. Townsend, "Paul's Cloak
Left at Troas"; also Dr. Richard Newton, M. C.
Hazard, editor of the <i>National Sunday School
Teacher</i>, Rev. Thomas K. Beecher of Elmira, and
Bishop Jesse T. Peck. These are a few samples
of the repast spread on the lecture platform of the
Assembly.</p>

<p>The Centennial of American Independence was
duly commemorated on Saturday, August 5th.
Bishop Simpson had been engaged to deliver the
oration, but was kept at home by illness and the
hour was filled with addresses by different speakers,
one of whom, Mr. W. Aver Duncan of London,
presented the congratulations of Old England to
her daughter across the sea. A children's centennial
was held in the afternoon, at which the writer
of this story spoke, and Frank Beard drew funny
pictures. We will not tell, though we know,
which of the two orators pleased the children most.
At the sunset hour an impressive Bible service was
held on the shore of the lake by Professor Sherwin,
followed in the Auditorium by a concert of slave-songs
from "The North Carolinians," a troupe of
negro college students. Late in the evening came
a gorgeous display on the lake, the Illuminated<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
Fleet. Every steam vessel plying Chautauqua
waters marched in line, led by the old three-decker
<i>Jamestown</i> all hung with Chinese lanterns, and
making the sky brilliant with fireworks. A week
later there was a commemorative tree-planting
on the little park in the angle between the present
Post Office building and the Colonnade. President
Lewis Miller, Dr. C. H. Payne, President of
Ohio Wesleyan University, Drs. Vail and Strong,
teachers of Hebrew and Greek at the Assembly,
Drs. O. H. Tiffany, T. K. Beecher, Richard Newton,
J. A. Worden, Beard and Sherwin, Dr. Wythe,
builder of Palestine Park and Director of Recreations
at the Assembly, and Prof. P. P. Bliss were
some, but not all of those who planted trees.
Afterward each tree was marked by a sign bearing
the name of its planter. These signs were lost in
the process of the years, and not all the trees are
now living. I think that I can identify the tree
planted by Frank Beard, but am not sure of any
other in the little group remaining at the present
time.</p>

<p>A noteworthy event at the Assembly of 1876
was the establishment of the Children's Meeting
as a daily feature. Meetings for the younger
people had been held from time to time in '74 and
'75 but this year Frank Beard suggested a regular<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
"Children's Hour," and the meetings were at first
conducted by him, mingling religion and humor.
Underneath his fun, Mr. Beard had a serious
soul. He read strong books, talked with his
friends on serious subjects, always sought to give
at least one illustrated Bible reading during
the Assembly, and resented the popular expectation
that he should be merely the funny man on
the program. He was assisted in his children's
meeting by the Rev. Bethuel T. Vincent, a brother
of the Founder, who was one of the most remarkable
teachers of children and young people whom I
have ever known. He could arrange the facts of
Bible knowledge in outline, could present them
in a striking manner, and drill them into the minds
of the boys and girls in an enduring way that
few instructors could equal and none surpass.
Before many sessions, Mr. Vincent's lesson became
the major feature and Beard's pictures the entertainment
of the meeting. The grown-ups came to
the meetings in such numbers as threatened to
crowd out the children, until the rule was made
that adults must take the rear seats,&mdash;no exception
being made even for the row of ear-trumpets&mdash;leaving
the front to the little people. Following
the custom of the Normal Class, an examination
in writing that would tax the brains of many<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
ministers was held at the close, limited to all
below a certain age, and prizes were awarded
to the best papers presented. As after forty years
I read the list of graduates in those early classes,
I find the names of men and women who have
distinguished themselves as ministers and missionaries
in the churches.</p>

<p>Early in the Assembly season, on August 7,
1876, a momentous step was taken in the appointment
by the instructors and students of the
Normal Class, of a committee to prepare a course
of study for the preparation of Sunday School
teachers. Eleven men, present at Chautauqua,
representing ten different denominations, were
chosen as the committee, and their report constituted
the first attempt at a <i>union</i> normal course.
Hitherto each church had worked out its own
independent course of study, and the lines laid
down were exceedingly divergent. This new
course prescribed forty lessons, a year's work
divided between the study of the Bible, the Sunday
School, the pupil, and the principles of teaching.
Comparing it with the official course now
adopted by the International Sunday School
Association, we find it for a year's study remarkably
complete and adapted to the teacher's needs.
For years it stood as the basis of the teacher-training<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
work at Chautauqua, was followed in the
preparation of text-books and pursued by many
classes in the United States and Canada.</p>

<p>The Centennial Year marked a note of progress
in the music at the Assembly. Up to this time
scarcely any music had been attempted outside of
the church and Sunday School hymnals. This
year the choir was larger than before, perhaps as
many as forty voices&mdash;think of that in contrast
with the three hundred now assembled in the choir-gallery
of the Amphitheater! Some anthems had
been attempted, but no oratorios, and no songs
of the secular character. It was Professor C. C.
Case who ventured with the doubtful permission
of Dr. Vincent to introduce at a concert some
selections from standard music outside the realm
of religion. Nobody objected, perhaps because
nobody recognized the significance of the step
taken; and it was not long before the whole world
of music was open to Chautauquans.</p>

<p>This writer remembers, however, that when at
an evening lecture, Dr. Vincent announced as a
prelude "Invitation to the Dance," sung by a
quartette of ladies, he received next day a letter
of protest against so immoral a song at a religious
gathering. If it had been sung without announcement
of its title, no one would have objected. On<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
the following evening, Dr. Vincent actually offered
a mild apology for the title. Since that time, the
same title has been printed on the Chautauqua
program, and the song encored by five thousand
people. Surely, "the world do move!"</p>

<p>Another step in the advancement of Chautauqua
was the incorporation of the Assembly. Up to
this year, 1876, the old charter of the Erie Conference
Camp Meeting Association had constituted
the legal organization. On April 28, 1876, new
articles of incorporation were signed at Mayville,
the county seat, providing for twenty-four trustees
of the Chautauqua Lake Sunday School Assembly.
In the charter the object was stated "to hold
stated public meetings from year to year upon
the grounds at Fair Point in the County of Chautauqua
for the furtherance of Sunday School
interests and any other moral and religious purpose
not inconsistent therewith." We note that
the old name Fair Point was still used to designate
the place of the Assembly. But it was for the last
time; with the next year's program a new name will
appear.</p>

<p>One of the first acts of the new Board was to
purchase a large addition to the camp-meeting
ground on its eastern border, and to lay out streets
upon it. This section included the campus and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
site of the buildings that now adorn the College
Hill. Some readers may inquire how the streets
of the Assembly received their names. During the
Camp Meeting period, the streets were named
after Bishops of the Methodist <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Episcoal'">Episcopal</ins> Church&mdash;Simpson
Avenue, Janes Avenue, Merrill Avenue,
and so on. Under the Assembly r&eacute;gime a few
more bishops were thus remembered; the road
winding around from Palestine Park to the land-gate
on the public highway was called Palestine
Avenue; Vincent Avenue ran straight up the hill
past the old Dining Hall, Miller Avenue parallel
with it on the west; and other streets later were
named after prominent Chautauqua leaders.
Wythe the first Secretary, Root, the first Vice-President,
Massey, a family from Canada making
liberal contributions, Miss Kimball, the efficient
Executive Secretary of the Reading Circle, and a
few other names in Chautauqua's annals. The
visitor to the present-day Chautauqua smiles as he
reads one of the earliest enactments of the new
Board, a resolution to instruct the Superintendent
of Grounds "to warn the person selling tobacco on
the grounds that he is engaged in an unlawful
occupation." We hasten to add that this anti-tobacco
regulation is no longer in operation.</p>

<p>The reader of this chapter perceives that the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
centennial year marked notable advancements at
Chautauqua: a lengthened and broadened program,
the establishing of a newspaper, the beginning
of the daily Children's Meeting with a course
of Bible study for the young, the organizing of a
definite course for the training of Sunday School
teachers, the incorporation of the Assembly with a
full Board of Trustees, with the transfer of the
property from the former camp-meeting proprietorship,
and a purchase of ground doubling
the extent of its territory. Chautauqua, only
three years old is already, in Scripture phrase,
lengthening its cords and strengthening its stakes.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<h3>A NEW NAME AND NEW FACES</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> fourth session of the Assembly opened in
1877 with a new name, <i>Chautauqua</i> taking the
place of old Fair Point. The former title had
caused some confusion. Fair Point was often
misread "Fairport," and letters wandered to distant
places of similar names. There was a Chautauqua
Lake station on the Erie Railway, and a
Chautauqua Point encampment across the lake
from Fair Point, but the name "Chautauqua"
had not been appropriated, and by vote of the
trustees it was adopted; the government was
requested to change the name of the Post Office,
and the railroads and steamboats to place Chautauqua
upon their announcements. Fair Point
disappeared from the record, and is now remembered
only by the decreasing group of the oldest
Chautauquans.</p>

<p>Every season brings its own anxieties, and as
the Assembly of 1877 drew near, a new fear came
to the leaders of Chautauqua. A few will remember,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
and others have heard, that in 1877 took place
the most extensive railway strike in the annals
of the nation. The large station of the Pennsylvania
Railroad in Pittsburgh was burned by a
mob, and for weeks at a time, no trains ran either
into or out of many important centers. Fortunately
the strike was adjusted and called off before
the Assembly opened, and on the first day four
thousand people entered the gates, a far greater
number than at any former opening.</p>

<p>On that year the menace of denominational
rivalry threatened to confront Chautauqua.
Across the lake, two miles from the Assembly,
another point reaches westward, facing the
Assembly ground. This tract was purchased by an
enterprising company belonging to Baptist
churches, and named Point Chautauqua. Its
founders disclaimed any intention of becoming
competitors with the Assembly. Their purpose,
as announced, was to supply sites for summer
homes, especially to members and friends of their
own denomination. They began by building an
expensive hotel at a time when the Assembly was
contented with small boarding houses; and they
soon followed the hotel with a large lecture-hall far
more comfortable than either the out-door auditorium
or the tent-pavilion at Chautauqua. To<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
attract visitors they soon provided a program
of speakers, with occasional concerts. Thus on
opposite shores of the lake two institutions were
rising, in danger of becoming rivals in the near
future. Nor was Chautauqua Point the only
rival in prospect. A year or two later a tent
was erected near Lakewood for the holding of an
assembly upon a "liberal" platform, where
speakers of more advanced views of religion and
the Bible could obtain a hearing. This gathering
favored an open Sunday, and welcomed the
steamers and railroad excursions on the day when
the gates of Chautauqua were kept tightly closed.
In those days the fear was expressed that Chautauqua
Lake, instead of being a center for Christians
of every name might furnish sites for separate
conventions of different sects, and thus minister
to dissension rather than to fellowship.</p>

<p>But these fears proved to be groundless. The
"liberal" convocation down the lake held but one
session, and left its promoters with debts to be
paid. The founders of the Baptist institution
made the mistake of beginning on too great a scale.
The hotel and lecture-hall involved the corporation
of Point Chautauqua in heavy debt, they
were sold, and the place became a village, like
other hamlets around the lake. The hotel was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
continued for some years, and the lecture-hall
became a dancing pavilion, tempting the young
people to cross the lake from Chautauqua where
dancing was under a strict taboo. Perhaps it
was an advantage to the thousands at the
Assembly to find only two miles away a place
where the rules were relaxed.</p>

<p>One story of a later season may be told in this
connection, for it was without doubt typical.
There are staid fathers and mothers attending
lectures on sociology and civics in the Hall of
Philosophy who could narrate similar experiences
if only they would. A youth and two young lasses
went out at the pier-gate for a sail across the lake.
They landed at Point Chautauqua, refreshed their
constrained bodies by a good dance, and then
sailed home again. But it was late, the gate was
closed, and it was of no avail to rattle the portals,
for the gate-keepers were asleep in their homes far
up the hill. The girls were somewhat alarmed,
but the young man piloted them through the
forest over a well-worn path to a place where
some pickets of the fence were loose and could be
shoved aside. They squeezed through and soon
were safely at their homes.</p>

<p>But their troubles were not over. Their tickets
had been punched to go out of the grounds, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
not to come in again. Technically, in the eyes of
the Chautauqua government they were still outside
the camp. This young man, however, was not
lacking in resources. He knew all the officials
from His Whiskers, the supreme chief of police,
down the list. Making choice of one gateman
whose nature was somewhat social he called upon
him in his box, talked in a free and easy way,
picked up his punch and began making holes in
paper and cards. When the gatekeeper's back was
turned, he quickly brought out the three tickets,
punched them for coming into the grounds, and
then laid down the nippers. The girls, now
officially within the grounds, were grateful to
their friend, and to manifest their regard wrought
for him a sofa-pillow which decorated his room in
college.</p>

<p>Something should be said just here concerning
the ticket-system of Chautauqua. It was devised
by the genius of Lewis Miller, to whom invention
was instinctive, and was improved to meet
every possible attempt at evasion. There were
one-day tickets, good for only one admission,
three-day tickets, week-tickets, and season-tickets,
all providing no admission on Sundays. They
were not transferable, and all except the one-day
variety bore the purchaser's name. Two or three<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
times during the season officers visited every house
and every lecture and class, even stopping everybody
on the streets to see that no single-day tickets
were kept for longer periods. Provision was made
for exchanging at the office short-stop tickets for
the longer time desired. If one wished to go outside
the gate on an errand, or for a sail on the lake,
he must leave his ticket, unless he was known to
the gate-keeper, in order to prevent more than one
person from using the same ticket. When one left
the Assembly for good, he gave up his ticket.
Every ticket had its number by which it could be
identified if lost or found; and the bulletin-board
contained plenty of notices of lost tickets.</p>

<p>It is said that one careful visitor carried his
ticket everywhere for a day or two, at each lecture-hall
and tent looking vainly for a window where it
might be shown. As it did not seem to be needed,
he left it in his room, only to find when he wished
to take out a boat, that he must go home and get
his ticket. When the day arrived for him to leave
Chautauqua, he placed his ticket in the bottom of
his trunk, as it would be needed no longer, intending
to take it home as a souvenir for his memory-book.
But, alas, at the gate, departing, he found that
ticket an absolute necessity. Without it, apparently
he must stay forever inside the walls of Chautauqua.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
So once more he overhauled his trunk,
dug up his ticket from its lowest strata, and
departed in peace.</p>

<p>One departure from camp-meeting customs at
once wrought a change in the aspect of Chautauqua
and greatly promoted its growth. We
have noted the fact that in the earlier years no
householder or tent-dweller was to receive boarders,
and all except those who cooked at home ate
in a common dining-hall. After the third Assembly,
this restriction was removed and anyone
could provide rooms and board upon paying
a certain percentage of receipts to the management.
The visitors who came in 1877 missed, but
not in sorrow, the dingy old Dining-Hall, which
had been torn down. But everywhere boarding
houses had sprung up as by magic, and cottages
had suddenly bulged out with new additions, while
signs of "Rooms and Board" greeted the visitants
everywhere. In fact, so eager were the landlords
for their prey, that runners thronged the wharf to
inform new arrivals of desirable homes, and one
met these agents even at the station in Mayville.
There was an announcement of the Palace Hotel,
the abode of luxurious aristocracy. The seeker
after its lordly accommodations found a frame
building, tent-covered and tent-partitioned into<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
small rooms for guests. But even this was an
improvement upon the rows of cots in the big
second story of the old lodging house, where fifty
people slept in one room, sometimes with the rain
dripping upon them through a leaky roof. Year
by year the boarding cottages grew in number, in
size, and in comfort. Fain would we name some of
these hostelries, whose patrons return to them
season after season, but we dare not begin the
catalogue, lest by an omission we should offend
some beloved landlady and her guests. In a few
years the Palace Hotel, half-house and half-tent,
gave place to the Hotel Athen&aelig;um, on the same
site, whose wide balcony looks out upon the lake,
and whose tower has been a home for some choice
spirits. The writer knows this for he has dwelt
beside them.</p>



<p>On the extreme southwestern limit of the old
camp ground was a ravine, unoccupied until 1877.
On the slopes of this valley the declivity was
cleared and terraced, seats&mdash;this time with backs&mdash;were
arranged upon its sides; toward the lake it
was somewhat banked up to form a place for the
speakers' platform. Over it was spread the tent,
formerly known as "the pavilion," brought from
the hill beside Vincent Avenue. This was the
nucleus out of which grew in after years the famous<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
Chautauqua Amphitheater. At first it was used
only on rainy days, but after a year or two gradually
took the place of the out-of-doors Auditorium.</p>

<p>Near the book-store on the hill stands a small
gothic, steep-roofed building, now a flower-shop.
It was built just before the Assembly of 1877 as a
church for the benefit of those who lived through
the year at Chautauqua, numbering at that time
about two hundred people. The old chapel was
the first permanent public building erected at
Chautauqua and still standing.</p>

<p>The program of '77 began with a council of
Reform and Church Congress, from Saturday,
August 4th to Tuesday, August 7th. Anthony
Comstock, that fearless warrior in the cause of
righteousness, whose face showed the scars of
conflict, who arrested more corrupters of youth,
and destroyed more vile books, papers, and pictures
than any other social worker, was one of the leading
speakers. He reported at that time the arrest
of 257 dealers in obscene literature and the destruction
of over twenty tons of their publications.
There is evil enough in this generation, but there
would have been more if Anthony Comstock had
not lived in the last generation. Another reformer
of that epoch was Francis Murphy, who had been
a barkeeper, but became a worker for temperance.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
His blue ribbon badge was worn by untold thousands
of reformed drunkards. He had a power
almost marvelous of freeing men from the chain of
appetite. I was present once at a meeting in New
York where from the platform I looked upon a
churchful of men, more than three hundred in
number, whose faces showed that the "pleasures
of sin" are the merest mockery; and after his
address a multitude came forward to sign Mr.
Murphy's pledge and put on his blue ribbon. At
Chautauqua Mr. Murphy made no appeal to victims
of the drink habit, for they were not there to
hear him, but he <i>did</i> appeal, and most powerfully, in
their behalf, to the Christian assemblage before
him. Another figure on the platform was that of
John B. Gough,&mdash;we do not call him a voice, for
not only his tongue, but face, hands, feet, even his
coat-tails, were eloquent. No words can do
justice to this peerless orator in the cause of reform.
These were the three mighty men of the council,
but the report shows twice as many names almost
as distinguished.</p>

<p>On the evening of Tuesday, August 7th, came
the regular opening of the Assembly proper, in the
Auditorium on the Point. The report of attendance
was far above that of any former opening day.
Dr. Vincent presided and conducted the responsive<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
service of former years&mdash;the same opening sentences
and songs used every year since the first
Assembly in 1874. We find fifteen names on the
list of the speakers on that evening, representing
many churches, many States, and at least two
lands outside our own.</p>

<p>Is another story of Frank Beard on that evening
beneath the dignity of history? When he came
upon the platform, he found the chairs occupied,
and sat down among the alto singers, where he
insisted on remaining despite the expostulations of
Mr. Sherwin. In the middle of the exercises,
the steamboat whistle at the pier gave an unusually
raucous scream. Mr. Sherwin came forward
and told the audience that there was no cause
for alarm; the sound was merely Mr. Beard tuning
his voice to sing alto. Two or three speakers
afterward incidentally referred to Mr. Beard as a
singer, and hoped that he might favor the congregation
with a solo. One of the speakers, an
Englishman, prefaced his talk by singing an
original song, set to Chautauqua music. That he
might see his verses, Mr. Sherwin took down a
locomotive headlight hanging on one of the trees,
and held it by the side of the singer. The Englishman,
short and fat, and Sherwin with dignity
supporting the big lantern, formed a tableau.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
Immediately afterward Dr. Vincent called on
Mr. Beard to speak; and this was his opening,
delivered in his peculiar drawl.</p>

<p>"I was a good mind to sing a song instead of
making a speech, but I was sure that Professor
Sherwin wouldn't hold the lantern for me to sing
by. He knows that he can't hold a candle to me,
anyhow!"</p>

<p>With Professor Sherwin, in charge of the music
in 1877, was associated Philip Phillips, whose solos
formed a prelude to many of the lectures. No one
who listened to that silvery yet sympathetic voice
ever forgot it. It will be remembered that President
Lincoln in Washington, after hearing him sing
<i>Your Mission</i>, sent up to the platform his written
request to have it repeated before the close of the
meeting. Mr. Phillips ever after cherished that
scrap of paper with the noblest name in the history
of America. Another musical event of the season
of 1877 was the visit of the Young Apollo Club of
New York, one of the largest and finest boy-choirs
in the country. They gave three concerts at Chautauqua,
which in the rank and rendering of their
music were a revelation to the listening multitudes.</p>

<p>While we are speaking of the music we must
make mention of songs written and composed
especially for Chautauqua. In Dr. Vincent's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
many-sided nature was a strain of poetry, although
I do not know that he ever wrote a verse. Yet he
always looked at life and truth through poetic
eyes. Who otherwise would have thought of songs
for Chautauqua, and called upon a poet to write
them? Dr. Vincent found in Miss Mary A.
Lathbury another poet who could compose fitting
verses for the expression of the Chautauqua spirit.
If I remember rightly her first song was prepared
for the opening in 1875, the second Assembly, and
as the earliest, it is given in full. In it is a reference
to some speakers at the first Assembly who
went on a journey to the Holy Land, and to one,
the Rev. F. A. Goodwin, whose cornet led the
singing in 1874, who became a missionary in India.</p>


<div class='center'><br />A HYMN OF GREETING</div>

<div class='poem'>
The flush of morn, the setting suns<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Have told their glories o'er and o'er</span><br />
One rounded year, since, heart to heart<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">We stood with Jesus by the shore.</span><br />
<br />
We heard his wondrous voice; we touched<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">His garment's hem with rev'rent hand,</span><br />
Then at his word, went forth to preach<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">His coming Kingdom in the land.</span><br />
<br />
And following him, some willing feet<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The way to Emmaus have trod;</span><br />
And some stand on the Orient plains,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">And some&mdash;upon the mount of God!</span><br />
<br />
While over all, and under all,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The Master's eye, the Master's arm,</span><br />
Have led in paths we have not known,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Yet kept us from the touch of harm.</span><br />
<br />
One year of golden days and deeds,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of gracious growth, of service sweet;</span><br />
And now beside the shore again<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">We gather at the Master's feet.</span><br />
<br />
"Blest be the tie that binds," we sing;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Yet to the bending blue above</span><br />
We look, beyond the face of friends,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To mark the coming of the Dove.</span><br />
<br />
Descend upon us as we wait<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With open heart&mdash;with open Word;</span><br />
Breathe on us, mystic Paraclete<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Breathe on us, Spirit of the Lord!</span><br />

<p>Another song of the second Assembly, and sung
through the years since at the services of the
Chautauqua Circle, was written and set to music
by Miss Lucy J. Rider of Chicago, afterward Mrs.
Lucy Rider Meyer, one of the founders of the
Deaconess movement in the Methodist Episcopal
Church. It begins with the lines:</p>

<div class='poem'>
The winds are whispering to the trees,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The hill-tops catch the strain,</span><br />
The forest lifts her leafy gates<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To greet God's host again.</span><br />
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>In the year of which we are writing, 1877, Mary
A. Lathbury gave to Chautauqua two songs which
have become famous, and are to be found in every
hymnal published during the last generation.
One is the Evening Song of Praise, "Day is dying in
the West," written to be sung at the even-tide
conferences beside the lake. The other, beginning,
"Break thou the bread of life," was the study
song for the Normal Classes. Another, less widely
known abroad, but sung every year at Chautauqua
is the Alumni Song, "Join, O friends, in a memory
song." These were a few of the many songs written
by Miss Lathbury at Dr. Vincent's request, and
set to music by Professor Sherwin. Originally
composed for the Normal Class, then the most
prominent feature on the program, after the Chautauqua
Circle arose to greatness in 1878, they were
adopted as the songs of that widespread organization.
For the C. L. S. C. a class song was
written each year, until the Chautauqua songs
grew into a book. Not all of these class songs
have become popular, but quite a number are still
sung at the Institution, especially at class-meetings
and in the Recognition Day services.</p>

<p>At the Assembly of 1877 the Normal Class still
stood in the foreground. Special courses of lessons
were given to Primary Teachers, by Mrs. Emily<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
Huntington Miller, Mrs. Wilbur F. Crafts, and the
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'every-popular'">ever-popular</ins> "Pansy"&mdash;Mrs. G. R. Alden. The
record informs us that the average attendance
at the four normal tents was more than five hundred.
Thorough reviews after the course were held
from time to time, and this year two competitive
examinations, one on August 14th for those unable
to remain until the close, but received examination
on the entire course&mdash;fifty questions in number;
the other on Tuesday, August 21st with three
hundred candidates for the diploma.</p>

<p>From 1876 for a number of years it was the custom
to hold an anniversary service on one evening,
for the Normal Alumni. The graduates marched
in procession, led by a band, a silken banner before
each class, and every member wearing a badge, to
the Pavilion in the ravine and afterward to its
successor the Amphitheater, where Chautauqua
songs were sung, and an address given by an orator,
the President of the Normal Alumni introducing
the speaker. It may have been in 1877, or maybe
in a later year, that John B. Gough was the orator
of the evening; and he began his address in this
wise:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I don't know why I have been chosen to speak to the
Alumni of Chautauqua, unless it is because I am an
Alumni myself, if that is the right word for one of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
them. I am art alumni of Amherst College; M.A.,
Master of Arts. I have a diploma, all in Latin. I
can't read a word of it, and don't know what it means,
but those long Latin words look as if they must mean
something great. When I was made an alumni I sat
on the platform of the Commencement Day; the
salutatorian&mdash;they told me that was his title&mdash;came
up and began to speak in Latin. He said something
to the President, and he bowed and smiled as if he
understood it. He turned to the trustees, and spoke
to them and they looked as wise as they could. He
said something to the graduating class, and they
seemed to enjoy it&mdash;all in Latin; and I hadn't the
remotest idea what it was all about. I kept saying to
myself, "I wish that he would speak just one word
that I could understand." Finally, the orator turned
straight in my direction and said, "Ignoramus!" I
smiled, and bowed, just as the others had. There was
one word that I could understand, and it exactly fitted
my case!</p></div>

<p>On the lecture platform of 1877, the outstanding
figure was the massive frame, the Jupiter-like
head, and the resonant voice of Joseph Cook, one
of the foremost men of that generation in the
reconciliation of science with religion&mdash;if the twain
ever needed a <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'reconcilation'">reconciliation</ins>. He gave six lectures,
listened to by vast audiences. The one most
notable was that entitled, "Does Death End All?"
in which he assembled a host of evidences, outside
of the Scriptures, pointing to the soul's immortality.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
Joseph Cook is well-nigh forgotten in this
day, but in his generation he was an undoubted
power as a defender of the faith.</p>

<p>If we were to name the Rev. James M. Buckley,
D.D., in the account of each year when
he spoke in the platform and the subjects of
his addresses, there would be room in our record
for few other lecturers. He was present at the
opening session in 1874, and at almost every
session afterward for more than forty years,&mdash;aggressive
in debate, instantaneous in repartee,
marvelous in memory of faces and facts, and ready
to speak upon the widest range of subjects. Every
year, Dr. Buckley held a question-drawer, and
few were the queries that he could not answer;
although in an emergency he might dodge a
difficulty by telling a story. For many years
he was the editor of the <i>Christian Advocate</i> in New
York, known among Methodists as the "Great
Official"; and he made his paper the champion of
conservatism, for he was always ready to break a
lance in behalf of orthodox belief or the Methodist
system. Another speaker this year was Dr. P. S.
Henson, a Baptist pastor successively in Philadelphia,
in Chicago, and in Boston, but by no
means limited to one parish in his ministry. He
spoke under many titles, but most popularly on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
"Fools," and "The Golden Calf," and he knew
how to mingle wisdom and wit in just proportions.
Abundant as were his resources in the pulpit and
on the platform, some of us who sat with him at the
table or on a fallen tree in the forest, thought
that he was even richer and more delightful, as well
as sagacious in his conversation. Dr. Charles F.
Deems, pastor of the Church of the Stranger in
New York, also came to Chautauqua for the first
time this year. He was at home equally in
theology, in science, and on the questions of the
day, with a remarkable power of making truth
seemingly abstruse simple to common people.
I recall a lecture on a scientific subject, at which
he saw on the front seat two boys, and he made it
his business to address those boys and simplify his
message seemingly for them while in reality for
his entire audience. But we cannot even name the
speakers who gave interest to the program of
1877.</p>

<p>One event of that season, however, must not be
omitted, for it became the origin of one noteworthy
Chautauqua custom. Mr. S. L. Greene,
from Ontario, Canada, a deaf-mute, gave an
address before a great audience in the Auditorium
under the trees. He spoke in the sign-language,
telling several stories from the gospels; and so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
striking were his silent symbols that everyone
could see the picture. We were especially struck
with his vivid representation of Christ stilling the
tempest. As he closed, the audience of at least
two thousand burst into applause, clapping their
hands. Dr. Vincent came forward, and said,
"The speaker is unable to hear your applause;
let us wave our handkerchiefs instead of clapping
our hands."</p>

<p>In an instant the grove was transformed into a
garden of white lilies dancing under the leaves of
the trees, or as some said, "into a snow-covered
field." The Superintendent of Instruction then
and there adopted the Chautauqua Salute of the
waving handkerchiefs as a token of special honor.
It is sparingly given, only two or three times during
the season, and never except when called for by the
head of Chautauqua in person.</p>

<p>At the annual commemoration on "Old First
Night" the Chautauqua salute is now given in a
peculiar manner to the memory of Lewis Miller
and other leaders who are no longer among us.
At the call of the President, the handkerchiefs
are slowly raised and held in absolute stillness for a
moment; then as silently lowered. The Chautauqua
salute is one of the traditions observed in
minutest detail after the manner of the Founders.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>Among the early issues of the <i>Assembly Herald</i>
appear some verses worthy of a place in our
history.</p>

It loves not silence, nor cold nor dark,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But it blooms in the haunts of men.</span><br />
<br />
The nation trails its great men<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of high and honored name,</span><br />
With clapping of hands and roll of drums<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And trump that sings of fame;</span><br />
But a sweet and silent greeting<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To the ones we love the best,</span><br />
Are the white Chautauqua lilies<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">In our summer home of rest.</span><br />
<br />
When the beautiful vesper service<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Has died on the evening air,</span><br />
And a thousand happy faces<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Are raised at the close of prayer,</span><br />
The voice of our well-loved leader<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Rings out in its clear-toned might;</span><br />
"We will give our salutation<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To an honored guest to-night."</span><br />
<br />
Then out of the speaking silence<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The white wings rise to air,</span><br />
Faintest of flutter and softest of sound,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Hail to the lilies rare!</span><br />
Thousands and tens of thousands,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Swiftly the lilies grow,</span><br />
Till the air is filled with the fluttering flowers,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As the winter air with snow.</span><br />
<br />
Hail to the fair white lilies!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Sweetest of salutations!</span><br />
The love of a thousand hearts they bear<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The greeting of the nations.</span><br />
The fairest of earth-born flowers<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Must wither by-and-by;</span><br />
But the lilies that live in the hearts they hail<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Will never, never die.</span><br />
<br />
O cold blast, spare the lily-bed<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That bears the wonderful flower!</span><br />
Give largely, O sky, of summer sun,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Largely of summer shower,</span><br />
Till the white flowers born in our summer home<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To earth's outermost rim be given;</span><br />
And the lilies open their cups of snow<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In the garden beds of heaven.</span><br />

<p>At the final meeting of the Assembly in 1877,
on Monday evening, August 20th, Dr. Vincent
outlined some plans for the coming year,&mdash;a large
hotel to replace the tented walls of the Pavilion
Palace, a new meeting-place to be built with walls
and roof over the natural amphitheater in the
ravine, some further courses of study, and many
improvements to the grounds. Then he added,
"And I shall not be surprised if&mdash;well, I will
not tell you&mdash;I have another dream I will not
give you." (A voice: "Let's have it.") "No, I am
going to hold that back, so you will want me to
come next year. But I believe that something
higher and larger is just out yonder in the near
future. Next summer, if we all live, I will tell you
about it." We shall see in the coming chapter
what that new development of Chautauqua was to
be,&mdash;the greatest in its history, and perhaps the
greatest in the history of education through the
land.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> "dream" of which Dr. Vincent gave a hint
at the close of the 1877 Assembly was destined to
become a reality in 1878. That year marks a
golden milestone in the history of Chautauqua, for
then was launched <i>The Chautauqua Literary and
Scientific Circle</i>, that goodly vessel which has
sailed around the world, has carried more than a
half-million of passengers, and has brought
inspiration and intelligence to multitudes unnumbered.
The conception arose in its author's
mind from the consciousness of his own intellectual
needs. He had longed, but vainly, for the
privilege of higher education in the college, but in
his youth there were no Boards of Education with
endowments extending a helping hand to needy
students. His school-days ended in the academy,
but not his education, for he was to the end of
his life a student, reading the best books, even
when their subjects and style demanded a trained
mind. As one who knew him well and for more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
than a generation, I may say without hesitation
that John Heyl Vincent possessed more knowledge
and richer culture than nine out of ten men holding
a college diploma.</p>

<p>But his heart went out in sympathy toward
others who like himself had missed the opportunity
of dwelling in college-cloisters, toward workers on
the farm, at the forge, in the store, in the office,
in the kitchen, and in the factory, whose longings
were like his own. Many of these would read
good books and drink at "the Pierian Spring," if
only they knew where to find the fountain&mdash;in
other words, if some intelligent, well-read person
would direct them, and place the best books
in their way. Gradually it dawned upon his mind
that everyone has some margin of time, at least
half an hour among the <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'tweny'">twenty</ins>-four, which
might be made useful under wise counsel to win
knowledge. He had not heard of that sentence
spoken by the great President of Harvard, that
"ten minutes a day, for ten years of a life, with
the right books, will give any one an education."
Indeed, that wise utterance came after the Chautauqua
Circle had been established and was
already giving guidance to many thousand people.</p>

<p>The conception came to Dr. Vincent of a course
of reading, which might become to the diligent a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
course of study, to include the principal subjects
of a college curriculum, all in the English language,
omitting the mathematical and technical departments
of science; a course that would give to its
careful reader, not the mental discipline of four
years in college, but something of the college outlook
upon life and letters. It was to embrace
the histories of the great nations that shaped
the world&mdash;Israel, Greece, Rome, Great Britain,
and America,&mdash;with shorter sketches of other
important lands; a view over the literature of the
ages, not in the original Greek, Latin, or German,
but as translated into our own tongue, presented
in a manner to give general understanding to the
many, and also to awaken the aspiring reader by
pointing out the path to thorough knowledge.
There are tens of thousands who have studied the
Bible only in the English version, yet could pass a
better examination upon its contents than many
graduates of the theological seminary. One might
read such an account of Homer's <i>Odyssey</i>, or
Virgil's <i>&AElig;neid</i>, or Dante's <i>Paradiso</i>, or Goethe's
<i>Faust</i>, as would inspire him to seek and study a
complete translation of these masterpieces. Dr.
Edward Everett Hale, from the beginning one of
the counselors of the Chautauqua Course, said
that it gives to its students "the language of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
time"; not a full detailed knowledge, but such a
general view as enables him to understand allusions
and references, to be at home with the thinkers and
writers of the age.</p>

<p>The Chautauqua Circle was not planned for
specialists, seeking full knowledge upon one subject,
but for general readers. Before it was inaugurated
there was already established in Boston
the Society for the Encouragement of Home Study.
The student who desired aid through this useful
organization was expected to select some one
department of knowledge, and then a list of
books or articles would be sent to him, with
suggestions, questions, and an examination. If
historical, it would not be history in general, but
the history of one country, or one period in its
annals. It might be the American, or French, or
English Revolution&mdash;very thorough, but only for
one seeking special knowledge. But the Chautauqua
plan contemplated a general round of
knowledge&mdash;history, literature, science, natural
and social, art, and religion: and this broad conception
was one great secret of its success. A
story which is typical was told the writer of this
volume as an absolute fact by one who claimed
to know the persons referred to. A young lady
called upon her pastor with this request;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
"I wish that you would tell me of some good
books to read. I'm tired of reading nothing
but novels, and want to find some books that are
worth while. Can't you give me the names of
some such books?"</p>

<p>The minister thought a moment, and then said
slowly, "Well, what kind of books do you want&mdash;religious
books, for instance?"</p>

<p>"No," said the girl, "I do not know as I wish to
read about religion. I get that in the church and
the Sunday School. But there must be some good
books of other kinds&mdash;can't you tell me of them?"</p>

<p>"What would you think of a course of reading
in history?" asked the pastor. Her face brightened
somewhat, and she answered, "Why, I think that
I might like to read history. What would you
recommend for me?"</p>

<p>The minister glanced at his own shelves, thought
a moment, and then said, "Well, I can't all at once
name a course on such an important subject as
history. Come next Wednesday, and I'll have a
list of good books for you."</p>

<p>She came, and he showed her a formidable
catalogue of books, saying:</p>

<p>"I have done the best that I could do, but the
list is longer than I had expected. It includes
eighty volumes. I wrote down one hundred and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
twenty volumes at first, but cut it down to eighty,
and it cannot be made shorter, not by a single
volume. In fact, it is not as complete as it
should be. You will begin with the greatest book
of history in all literature&mdash;Gibbon's <i>Decline and
Fall of the Roman Empire</i>, in nine volumes!"</p>

<p>The young lady was appalled, and never went
through the first chapter of Gibbon's mighty work.
This was before the Chautauqua Home Reading
Course was evolved. After that had been launched
any intelligent minister, or helpful librarian, would
simply have said to the enquirer, "Send for a
circular of the C. L. S. C.; that will give you
exactly what you need."</p>

<p>There comes to my own mind a vivid remembrance
of that evening when for the first time I
heard those magic words&mdash;"The Chautauqua
Literary and Scientific Circle." In the early
spring of 1878, Dr. Vincent had just returned from
an official visit to Europe, and I was no longer at
Plainfield, five minutes' walk from his home, but
by the revolution of the itinerant wheel a pastor,
thirty miles distant. A message came asking
me to spend an evening with him and talk over
some new plans for Chautauqua. Of course, I
obeyed the call, for I always gained more than I
gave in any conversation with that fruitful mind.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
We sat in front of the fireplace in his study, and
I listened while for an hour he talked of a new
organization which he proposed to launch in the
coming season, to be named <i>The Chautauqua
Literary and Scientific Circle;</i> with a course of
study to be carried through four years, with forty
minutes as each day's task, for nine or ten months
of each year, in the various branches of knowledge,
analogous to the four years of college study. He
was so full of his theme and so eloquent upon it
that I could only listen to the outpouring utterances.
The general purpose was clear before him,
but not the details of its operation. Dr. Vincent's
eyes were ever set upward toward the mountain-tops
glorious in the sunlight, and he did not always
think of the thickets to be cut and the path to be
made from the lower plain to the summit. I could
see some of the difficulties in the way, some
obstacles that must be overcome, and sagely shook
my head in doubt of the scheme. It was a radical
departure from the earlier ideals, for thus far
everything on the Chautauqua program had been
along the line of Sunday School training, and this
was a forsaking of the well-trodden path for a new
world of secular education. Why try to rival the
high schools and arouse the criticism of the colleges?
How would the regular constituency<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
of Chautauqua feel at this innovation? No
doubt under the spell of his enthusiasm, some
would join the proposed class in literature and
science&mdash;but how could science be studied by untrained
people without laboratories, or apparatus,
or teachers? And after the spell of the Chautauqua
season would not the pledges be forgotten
at home, and the numbers in the home classes
soon dwindle away to nothing?</p>

<p>Dr. Vincent asked me a question as we sat in the
glow of the fireplace. "How many do you think
can be depended on to carry on such a course as is
proposed?"</p>

<p>"Oh, perhaps a hundred!" I answered.
"People who want to read will find books, and
those who don't care for reading will soon tire of
serious study."</p>

<p>The doctor sprang up from his chair and walked
nervously across the room. "I tell you, Mr.
Hurlbut, the time will come when you will see a
thousand readers in the C. L. S. C."</p>

<p>I smiled, the smile of kindly unbelief! His
impulse, his dream was noble, to be sure, but so
utterly impracticable. I tell this little tale to
show how far below the reality were the expectations
of us both. Only a few years after this
conversation the enrolled members of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
C. L. S. C. counted sixty thousand readers pursuing
the course at one time, with probably as many
more readers unregistered.</p>

<p>The opening evening of the Assembly was held
on Tuesday evening, August 6th. The vesper
service beginning, "The Day goeth away, The
Shadows of evening are stretched out, Praise
waiteth for Thee, O God, in Zion," etc., was read
responsively in the Auditorium between the
Miller Cottage and the Vincent tent, then not far
from the Point, when a sudden shower fell and a
general rush was made to the new Pavilion in the
ravine on the west. That was the last opening
service attempted out-of-doors. Since that evening,
the Pavilion, soon to become the Amphitheater,
has supplied the stage for the speakers,
sedate or humorous, short or long,&mdash;some of them
longer than the audience desired&mdash;on "Old First
Night." A few lectures were given from time to
time in the old Auditorium, but after the season of
1879 it was left for smaller meetings of couples
in communion of soul on the seats here and there
under the trees.</p>

<p>The inauguration of the Chautauqua Literary
and Scientific Circle took place in the Pavilion
on the afternoon of Saturday, August 10, 1878.
On the platform, then lower than most of the seats,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
were a telescope, a microscope, a globe, some
scientific apparatus, and a table filled with books,
giving a scholastic setting to the exercises. Dr.
Vincent presided, and with him were Bishop
Randolph S. Foster of Boston, Dr. Henry W. Warren
of Philadelphia, himself two years afterward
to become a bishop, Professor William C. Wilkinson,
whose pen in the following years wrote many
books for the readers of the C. L. S. C., Professor
James Strong of wide learning, and several other
eminent men. The address of the day, unfolding
the purpose and plan of the Circle, was given by
Dr. Vincent. Many of us who heard him on that
afternoon have thought since that this was the
masterpiece of his lifetime, and it might worthily
be so, for it launched a movement in education,
the most influential and wide-reaching of any in
the annals of the nation.</p>

<p>I wish that it were possible to reprint that great
address as reported in full in the <i>Assembly Herald</i>,
for never was the conception of Chautauqua at
home for nine months of the year more clearly set
forth, but a few quotations and outlines must suffice.
He began by calling attention to four classes of
people. First, those who inherit from their
ancestors wealth, ease, and large intellectual
opportunities, who find college doors opening<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
almost of their own accord before them. Second,
there are those born under the necessity of daily
toil. For these the education of the public school
is provided; but it is limited and rarely appreciated.
Children go to school to get knowledge enough for
bread-winning and no more. Third, there are
those who, born under necessity, struggle into
opportunity, fight their way up into power, and
make themselves the intellectual heroes of their
time. Fourth, there are many born under necessity,
who lack the vision at the beginning, who
enter upon a life of trade or labor which may bring
them success, but who gradually awake to realize
how much they have lost, without realizing that it
is never too late to gain culture and that education
ends only with life. This is the class in every
community which our new organization aims to
reach, to uplift, to inspire and stimulate. We
propose to give to these people in every walk of
life, both the rich, the middle class, and the poor&mdash;all
in one class in their condition and their needs&mdash;the
college student's outlook upon the world of
thought, by short studies in literature and science,
by the reading of books, by the preparation of
synopses of books read, by written reports of books
read, and by correspondence with experts in the
several departments.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Here are some of the advantages of this organization:
It will develop higher and nobler tastes,
increase mental power, exalt home-life, giving authority
and home-help in public school studies and organizing
homes into reading circles. It will counteract
the influence of our modern pernicious literature and
sweeten and enrich the daily lives of poor and hard-working
people. It will bring the more cultivated
people into contact with the less scholarly, promote
a true appreciation of science, and tend to increase
the spiritual life and power of the church. All knowledge
becomes glorified in the man whose heart is
consecrated to God.</p></div>

<p>As I copy these words in the year 1920, more than
forty years after they were spoken and printed, with
each sentence there rise to my mind instances that
have come to my own knowledge of every one of
these prophecies fulfilled. Chautauqua through its
home-reading course has accomplished far more
than its founder even dreamed.</p>

<p>The speaker answered an objection to the plan
of study based upon its superficiality.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Superficial it is, and so is any college course of
study. The boy who stands at the close of his senior
year, on Commencement Day, to receive his parchment
and whatever honors belong to him, who does
not feel that his whole course has been superficial,
will not be likely to succeed in the after struggle of life.
But superficiality is better than absolute ignorance.
It is better for a man to take a general survey, to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
catch somewhere a point that arrests him; for the man
who never takes a survey never catches the point in
which dwell the possibilities of power for him. When
you sow seed, it is not the weight of the seed put into
the soil that tells, it is the weight of the harvest that
comes after.</p></div>

<p>Here are some of the closing words of the address:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>How glad I should be if I should find in the future
years that more boys and girls are going to our high
schools and universities because of the impulse received
here at Chautauqua! And I say to you: with
all your getting, get understanding. Look through
microscopes, but find God. Look through telescopes,
but find God. Look for Him revealed in the throbbing
life about you, in the palpitating stars above, in
the marvelous records of the earth beneath you, and in
your own souls. Study the possibilities which God
unfolds, and make of yourself all that you can. The
harder the struggle, the brighter the crown. Have
faith and holy purpose. Go on to <i>know</i> and to <i>will</i>,
to <i>do</i> and <i>be</i>. When outward circumstances discourage,
trample the circumstances under foot. Be
master of circumstances, like the king that God has
called you to be. God give you such hearts, such toil,
such triumphs, and give you such masterhood as shall
one day place you among the kings and priests of a
redeemed and purified universe!</p></div>

<p>After the applause following this address subsided,
a poem was read, written for the occasion
by the ever-ready Mary A. Lathbury. It pictured<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
the modern Chautauqua as representing the old
Jerusalem which pilgrims sought for worship and
inspiration. We can only quote its final stanzas:</p>

<div class='poem'>
The Life of God is shining<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Upon her where she stands;</span><br />
And leaf by leaf unfolding<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Within her reverent hands,</span><br />
The earth and seas and heavens<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Disclose her secrets old,</span><br />
And every force of Nature<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Reveals its heart of gold!</span><br />
Now knoweth she the answer<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That ends the schoolmen's strife,&mdash;</span><br />
That knowledge bears no blossom<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Till quickened by the Life.</span><br />
<br />
O holy, holy city!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The life of God with men!</span><br />
Descending out of heaven<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To ne'er ascend again.</span><br />
O Light, O Life immortal!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">One sea above, below!</span><br />
If unto us be given<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That blessed thing,&mdash;<i>to know</i>&mdash;</span><br />
Hope's beatific vision,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And Faith's prophetic sight</span><br />
Shall die before the fullness<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of that unclouded Light.</span><br />
</div>

<p>After the reading of the poem, Dr. Vincent said,
"In the preparation for this important occasion, I
have consulted some of the most experienced and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
practical educators of the country, and from a
number of distinguished gentlemen I have received
letters relating to this movement."</p>

</div>

<p>We can only quote a sentence or two from a few
of these letters.</p>

<p>Dr. Lyman Abbott wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>It seems to me if you can lay out such plans of
study, particularly in the departments of practical
science, as will fit our boys and young men in the mining,
manufacturing, and agricultural districts to
become, in a true though not ambitious sense of the
term, scientific and intelligent miners, mechanics, and
farmers, you will have done more to put down strikes
and labor riots than an army could; and more to solve
the labor problem than will be done by the Babel-builders
of a hundred labor-reform conventions.</p></div>

<p>Professor Luther T. Townsend, of Boston
University:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Your plan for the promotion of Christian culture in
art, science, and literature, among the masses of the
American people, strikes me as one of the grandest
conceptions of the nineteenth century.</p></div>

<p>Dr. A. A. Hodge, of Princeton:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The scheme is a grand one, and only needs to insure
its success that efficient administration which has
so eminently characterized all your enterprises.
History and nature are the spheres in which God
exercises his perfections, through which they are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
manifested to us. All human knowledge should be comprehended
in the one system of which Christ is the center,
and illuminated with the light of revelation.</p></div>

<p>Dr. Arthur Gilman:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Your fears of "superficiality" do not trouble me.
For your course will probably aim rather to direct
the mind toward the way in which you wish it to
develop, than store it with the details of knowledge.
You wish to awaken, rather than cultivate.</p></div>

<p>Dr. Howard Crosby, of New York:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Your scheme to induce business men and others
to pursue useful courses of reading in science and
history is worthy of all commendation. While we
cannot expect to make such persons scientists or
scholars, we may expect them to become appreciative
of things scientific or scholarly, and to be able to
discriminate between the false and the true.</p></div>

<p>He added some valuable suggestions regarding
the kind of books that should be chosen; and the
hope that the course, instead of becoming a substitute
for the college, might lead to the college.</p>

<p>Dr. Charles F. Deems, of New York, gave his
heartiest approval of the plan, and stated that he
was holding in his own church classes in all the
departments named, and would enroll them under
the Chautauqua system, with examinations and
the diploma at the completion of the course.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>Dr. William F. Warren, President of Boston
University, wrote a letter in which he said:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>You are aiming to secure that without which
every system of education is weak, and with which any
is strong; namely, interested personal home work
the year round. And you seem to carry these home
students to the point where they can go alone, if they
cannot have the help of the schools.</p></div>

<p>One of these letters must be given in full, notwithstanding
its length. Dr. Vincent introduced
it with an account of his interview with its author,
the venerable William Cullen Bryant, the oldest
of his group&mdash;the American poets of the mid-century.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I wrote him afterward a long letter [said Dr.
Vincent], defining the scheme more fully. While
in London a few weeks ago I received from him the
following letter, written with his own hand,&mdash;written
but a few weeks before his death. This letter has
never been read in public and has never been in print.</p>

<div class='right'>
<span class="smcap">New York</span>, May 18, 1878.<br />
</div>

<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,

<p>I cannot be present at the meeting called to organize
the Chautauqua Literary and Scientific Circle, but I
am glad that such a movement is on foot, and wish
it the fullest success. There is an attempt to make
science, or a knowledge of the laws of the material
universe, an ally of the school which denies a separate
spiritual existence and a future life; in short, to borrow<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
of science weapons to be used against Christianity.
The friends of religion, therefore, confident that one
truth never contradicts another, are doing wisely
when they seek to accustom the people at large to
think and to weigh evidence as well as to believe.
By giving a portion of their time to a vigorous training
of the intellect, and a study of the best books, men
gain the power to deal satisfactorily with questions
with which the mind might otherwise have become
bewildered. It is true that there is no branch of
human knowledge so important as that which teaches
the duties that we owe to God and to each other, and
that there is no law of the universe, sublime and
wonderful as it may be, so worthy of being made fully
known as the law of love, which makes him who obeys
it a blessing to his species, and the universal observance
of which would put an end to a large proportion of the
evils which affect mankind. Yet is a knowledge of
the results of science, and such of its processes as lie
most open to the popular mind, important for the
purpose of showing the different spheres occupied by
science and religion, and preventing the inquirer from
mistaking their divergence from each other for
opposition.</p>

<p>I perceive this important advantage in the proposed
organization, namely, that those who engage in it will
mutually encourage each other. It will give the
members a common pursuit, which always begets a
feeling of brotherhood; they will have a common topic
of conversation and discussion, and the consequence
will be, that many who, if they stood alone, might soon
grow weary of the studies which are recommended to
them, will be incited to perseverance by the interest
which they see others taking in them. It may happen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
in rare instances that a person of eminent mental
endowments, which otherwise might have remained
uncultivated and unknown, will be stimulated in
this manner to diligence, and put forth unexpected
powers, and, passing rapidly beyond the rest, become
greatly distinguished, and take a place among the
luminaries of the age.</p>

<p>I shall be interested to watch, during the little
space of life that may yet remain to me, the progress
and results of the plan which has drawn from me
this letter.</p>

<div class='sig'>
<span style="margin-right: 6em;">I am, Sir,</span><br />
<span style="margin-right: 2em;">Very truly yours,</span><br />
<span class="smcap">W. C. Bryant</span>.<br />
</div></div>

<p>The distinguished writer of this letter died only
a month and four days after writing it, on June 12,
1878, as the result of a sunstroke while he was
making an address at the unveiling of a statue in
the Central Park. He was in the eighty-fifth year
of his age.</p>

<p>After some short addresses by men on the platform,
Bishop Foster, Professor Wilkinson, Dr.
Strong, and others, Dr. Vincent announced as the
first book of the course, Green's <i>Short History of the
English People</i>, and invited all desirous of joining
the C. L. S. C. to write their names and addresses
upon slips of paper and hand them to anyone on the
platform. It might have been supposed that
a circular would be ready containing a statement<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
of the course for the first year, regulations
and requirements of the organization, the fee of
membership, etc.; but in the enthusiasm of the
time those desirable requisites had been forgotten.
Everybody looked around for a slip of paper.
Visiting cards were made useful, margins were
torn off newspapers, and there was an overwhelming
rush toward the platform to join the new
circle. On that afternoon seven hundred names
were received and the number grew hourly until
the close of the Assembly. Nearly all the regular
year-by-year visitors to Chautauqua became
members of this "Pioneer Class," as it was afterwards
named; and to this day its fellowship, after
forty-two years, still continues one of the largest
at its annual gatherings in Pioneer Hall, the building
which it erected as its home.</p>

<p>The book-store was crowded with applicants
for Green's History, and the few copies on hand,
not more than half a dozen, were instantaneously
disposed of. An order was telegraphed to the
Harper Brothers in New York for fifty copies, on
the next morning for fifty more, then for another
hundred, day after day the demand increasing.
The Harpers were astounded at the repeated calls,
and telegraphed for particulars as to the reason
why everybody at an almost unknown place<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
called Chautauqua had gone wild in demand for
this book. Their stock on hand was exhausted
long before the Assembly was ended, and most
of the members of this "Class of 1882" were
compelled to wait a month or more for their books.
Public libraries were by no means numerous in
those days while Andrew Carnegie was making
the millions to be spent later in establishing them,
but wherever they were, Green's Short History
was drawn out, and a waiting list made for it,
to the amazement of librarians, who vainly proposed
the substitution of other standard English
histories. Whoever could buy, borrow, or beg a
copy of Green, rejoiced&mdash;we hope that no Chautauquan,
in his hunger for literature, <i>stole</i> one, but
we are not sure. People otherwise honest have been
known to retain borrowed umbrellas and books.</p>

<p>In the Class of 1882 eight thousand four hundred
names were enrolled, for the members brought
home from Chautauqua the good news, and
families, neighbors, and friends everywhere sent
in their applications. Later we shall learn what
proportion of these followed the course through
the four years and marched under the arches to
their Recognition as graduates.</p>

<p>An addition had been made to the grounds on
the west, and here Dr. Vincent chose a square<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
shaded by abundant beech-trees, as the center
and home of the C. L. S. C. He named it St.
Paul's Grove, choosing the apostle who represented
the combination of the fervent heart and
the cultured mind, an ideal for all Chautauquans.
Besides Dr. Vincent's address at this time, another
was given by Governor A. H. Colquitt of
Georgia, President of the International Sunday
School Convention. The dedicatory prayer was
offered by Bishop Foster and an appropriate
hymn written by Dr. Hyde of Denver was sung
by Professor Sherwin and his choir. St. Paul's
Grove, and its pillared temple soon to rise, will
appear often in our story as one of the sacred spots
at Chautauqua.</p>

<p>We must not overlook the daily program during
this epoch-making season of 1878. There were
the daily classes studying Greek and Hebrew
under Drs. Strong and Vail. There was a class
in microscopy, with the Misses Lattimore; there
was the normal class with a full number of students
ending with the successful examination of more
than one hundred and forty new members of the
Normal Alumni Association. The annual reunion
of the Normal Alumni was celebrated with
the usual banners, procession, address, the illuminated
fleet and fireworks.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>The lecture platform of 1878 stood at as high
a level as ever. If any one speaker bore off the
honors of that year, it was Bishop Randolph
S. Foster of the Methodist Episcopal Church,
whose lectures on "Beyond the Grave" drew the
largest audiences and aroused the deepest interest.
They were afterward published in a volume which
attracted wide attention, and brought some
criticism from preachers of the conservative
school. There were even some who talked of an
impeachment and trial, but they did not venture
to bring the greatest thinker and theologian in
their church to the bar. Other lecturers who
made their mark were Dr. Robert M. Hatfield
of Chicago, President Charles H. Fowler, Dr.
(soon after Bishop) John F. Hurst, Dr. John Lord,
the historian-lecturer, Dr. Joseph Cook, Professor
William North Rice, Dr. T. DeWitt Talmage,
with his entertaining lecture on "Big Blunders,"
and Dr. Charles F. Deems on "The Superstitions
of Science."</p>

<p>One remarkable meeting was held on the afternoon
of the opening day, Tuesday, August 6th.
In the Pavilion four men gave in turn the distinctive
doctrines and usages of their several
churches. These were the Rev. Mr. Seymour,
Baptist, Rev. Mr. Williston, Congregationalist,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
Rev. Dr. Hatfield, Methodist, and Rev. J. A.
Worden, Presbyterian. Without attempt at controversy
or criticism each speaker named the
principles for which his branch of the Holy Catholic
Church stood. There was the most cordial feeling.
Each listener believed as strongly as before
in his own denomination, but many felt a greater
respect for the other branches of the true vine. At
the close all the congregation sang together,</p>

<div class='poem'>
Blest be the tie that binds<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Our hearts in Christian love.</span><br />
</div>

<p>A new building took its place upon the grounds,
and speedily became the center of many activities.
It was called "The Children's Temple," built
through the generous gift of President Lewis
Miller, in the general plan of his Sunday School
Hall at Akron, Ohio, a central assembly room
with folding doors opening or closing a number of
classrooms around it. For many years it was the
home of the Children's Class, under Rev. B. T.
Vincent and Frank Beard, which grew to an
attendance of three hundred daily. They wore
badges of membership, passed examinations upon
a systematic course, and received diplomas.
Soon an Intermediate Department became necessary
for those who had completed the children's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
course, and this also grew into a large body of
members and graduates.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<h3>CHAUTAUQUA ALL THE YEAR</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">During</span> those early years the Chautauqua
sessions were strenuous weeks to both Miller and
Vincent. Mr. Miller brought to Chautauqua for a
number of seasons his normal class of young people
from the Akron Sunday School, requiring them to
attend the Chautauqua normal class and to take
its examination. He acted also as Superintendent
of the Assembly Sunday School, which was like
organizing a new school of fifteen hundred members
every Sunday, on account of the constant
coming and going of students and teachers. But
Mr. Miller's time and thoughts were so constantly
taken up with secular details, leasing lots,
cutting down trees, and setting up tents, settling
disputes with lot holders and ticket holders, and a
thousand and one business matters great and small&mdash;especially
after successive purchases had more
than doubled the territory of the Assembly,&mdash;that
he was able to take part in but few of its exercises.
One out of many perplexing situations may be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
taken as a specimen. In one purchase was
included a small tract on the lake-shore outside
the original camp ground, where some families
from a distance had purchased holdings and built
small cottages, being independent both of the
camp-meeting and the Assembly. Some members
of this colony claimed the right of way to go in and
out of the Assembly at all times, Sundays as well as
week-days, to attend lectures and classes without
purchasing tickets. Others in the older parts of
the ground under camp-meeting leases declared
themselves beyond the jurisdiction of new rules
made by the Assembly trustees. A strong party
appeared demanding that the lot owners as a body
should elect the trustees,&mdash;which meant that the
future of a great and growing educational institution
should be shaped not by a carefully selected
Board under the guidance of two idealists,&mdash;one
of whom was at the same time a practical businessman,
a rare combination,&mdash;but by a gathering
of lot-holders, not all of them intelligent, and the
majority people who were keeping boarding-houses
and were more eager for dollars than for
culture. I remember a conversation with the
proprietor of one of the largest boarding-houses
who urged that the grounds be left open, with no
gate-fees or tickets; but instead a ticket-booth at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
the entrance to each lecture-hall, so that people
would be required to pay only for such lectures
and entertainments as they chose to attend! I
could name some Assemblies calling themselves
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'chautauquas'">Chautauquas</ins>, where this policy was pursued; and
almost invariably one season or at most two
seasons terminated their history.</p>

<p>Added to these and other perplexities was the
ever-present question of finance. The rapid
growth of the movement caused a requirement of
funds far beyond the revenue of the Association.
Its income came mainly from the gate-fees, to
which was added a small tax upon each lot, and
the concessions to store-keepers; for the prices
obtained by the leasing of new lots must be held
as a sinking fund to pay off the mortgages incurred
in their purchase. There came also an imperative
demand for a water-supply through an aqueduct,
a sewer-system, and other sanitary arrangements
made absolutely necessary by the increase of
population. In those years Mr. Miller's purse
was constantly opened to meet pressing needs, and
his credit enabled the trustees to obtain loans
and mortgages. But despite his multitudinous
cares and burdens, no one ever saw Mr. Miller
harassed or nervous. He was always unruffled,
always pleasant, even smiling under the most<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
trying conditions. His head was always clear,
his insight into the needs not only of the time but
of the future also was always sure, and his
spinal column was strong enough to stand firm
against the heaviest pressure. He knew instinctively
when it was wise to conciliate, and
when it was essential to be positive. The present
generation of Chautauquans can never realize
how great is their debt of gratitude to Lewis Miller.
The inventor and manufacturer of harvesting
machines at Akron and Canton, Ohio, busy at his
desk for eleven months, found the Swiss Cottage
beside Chautauqua Lake by no means a place of
rest during his brief vacation.</p>

<p>Nor were the burdens upon the other Founder
lighter than those of his associate. The two men
talked and corresponded during the year regarding
the coming program, but the selection, engagement,
and arrangement of the speakers was mainly
Dr. Vincent's part. At the same hour, often
half a dozen meetings would be held, and care
must be taken not to have them in conflict in their
location and their speakers. Changes in the
program must often be made suddenly after a
telegram from some lecturer that he could not
arrive on the morrow. New features must be
introduced as the demand and the opportunity<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
arose,&mdash;the Baptists, or Methodists, or Congregationalists,
or Disciples desired a meeting, for
which an hour and a place must be found. The
only one who kept the list of the diversified assemblages
was Dr. Vincent. He had no secretary
in those days to sit at a desk in an office and
represent the Superintendent of Instruction. His
tent at the foot of the grounds was a stage whereon
entrances and exits were constant. Moreover, the
audience was apt to measure the importance of a
lecture by the presence of Dr. Vincent as presiding
officer or a substitute in his place introducing
the speaker. The Vincent temperament was less
even and placid than the Miller; and the Assembly
of those early years generally closed with its
Superintendent in a worn-out physical condition.</p>

<p>And it must not be forgotten that Dr. Vincent
like his Associate Founder was a busy working
man all the year. He was in charge of the Sunday
School work in a great church, supervising Sunday
Schools in Buenos Ayres, and Kiu-kiang, and
Calcutta, as well as in Bangor and Seattle. At
his desk in New York and Plainfield he was the
editor of nine periodicals, aided by a small number
of assistants. Several months of every year were
spent in a visitation of Methodist Conference
setting forth the work, and stirring up a greater<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
interest in it. He was lecturing and preaching and
taking part in conventions and institutes everywhere
in the land. Chautauqua was only one of
the many activities occupying his mind, his heart,
and his time.</p>

<p>The Assembly of 1878, with the inauguration of
the C. L. S. C., had been especially exhausting to
Dr. Vincent. Imagine, if you can, his feelings
when he found his desks in the office and the home
piled high with letters concerning the new movement
for Chautauqua readings all the year. He
was simply overwhelmed by the demands, for
everybody must have an immediate answer.
Walking out one day, he met one of the teachers
of the High School, told her of his difficulties, and
asked her if she could suggest anyone who might
relieve him. She thought a moment, and then
said:</p>

<p>"I think I know a girl of unusual ability who
can help you&mdash;Miss Kate Kimball, who was
graduated from the High School last June, and I
will send her to you."</p>

<p>She came, a tall young lady, only eighteen years
old, with a pair of brown eyes peculiarly bright,
and a manner retiring though self-possessed. Dr.
Vincent mentioned some of the help that he required,
but looked doubtfully at her, and said,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
"I am afraid that you are too young to undertake
this work."</p>

<p>She answered, "I would like to try it; but if you
find that I am not equal to it, I will not be offended
to have it given to some other person. Let me see
if I can help you even a little."</p>

<p>That was the introduction of Miss Kate Fisher
Kimball to the work and care of the Chautauqua
Literary and Scientific Circle, of which she was
the Executive Secretary until her death in 1917.
She was born in 1860, at Orange, New Jersey, her
father, Dr. Horace F. Kimball, being a dentist
with office in New York. Young as she was, she
at once showed rare abilities in administration.
Under her vigorous and wise efforts, the C. L. S. C.
was soon reduced to a system, the members were
classified, the course was made orderly, circulars
of various sorts were prepared and sent out to
answer as many kinds of questions, and the calls
from all over the nation, almost all over the world
were met. Kate Kimball had a wonderful memory,
as well as a systematic mind. Dr. Vincent
would tell her in one sentence the answer to be sent
to a letter, and twenty sentences in succession for
twenty letters. She made no note, but remembered
each one; would write to each correspondent
a letter framed as it should be, with a clear statement,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
of just the right length, never getting the
wrong answer on her pen. And if six months
afterward, or six years, there came a letter requiring
the same answer, she did not need to ask for
information, but could send the right reply without
consulting the letter-file. Thousands of correspondents
who may never have met her will
remember that signature, "K. F. Kimball," for
they have been strengthened and inspired by
letters signed with it.</p>

<p>I have heard more than one person say, "I want
to go to Chautauqua, if it is only to become
acquainted with K. F. Kimball."</p>

<p>Let me transcribe a few sentences written by
Mr. Frank Chapin Bray, who as Editor of <i>The
Chautauquan Magazine</i>, was for years in close
relation with Miss Kimball.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Many will always think of her as a kind of Chautauqua
Mother Superior. The details of the work
of an Executive Secretary are not transcribable for
they were multifarious drudgeries year after year
which defy analysis. During thirty-five years she
made them the means of transmitting a great idea as
a dynamic force vital to hundreds of thousands of
men and women the world around.</p></div>

<p>Next to the originating genius of John H.
Vincent, the influence which made the Chautauqua<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
Home Reading Course one of the mightiest educational
forces of the nineteenth century was the
tireless energy and the executive ability of Kate
F. Kimball.</p>

<p>About 1912 she was suddenly taken with an
illness, not deemed serious at the time, but later
found to have been a slight paralytic shock. She
was given a year's vacation from office work and
spent most of it in England and on the continent.
Some of her friends think that if she had absolutely
abstained from work, she might have recovered her
health; but while in England she visited nearly all
its great cathedrals, and wrote a series of articles
for <i>The Chautauquan</i> on "An English Cathedral
Journey," afterward embodied in one of the best
of the non-technical books on that subject. She
returned to her desk, but not in her former vigor.
Year by year her powers of thought and action
declined, and she died June 17, 1917, in the fifty-seventh
year of her age, leaving after her not only a
precious memory but an abiding influence; for the
plans initiated by her adaptive mind are still those
effective in the shaping of the Chautauqua Circle.</p>

<p>The course of reading for the first year was as
follows: Green's <i>Short History of the English People;</i>
with it the little hand-book by Dr. Vincent&mdash;Chautauqua
Text-Book No. 4, <i>Outline of English</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
<i>History;</i> an arrangement by periods, enabling the
reader to arrange the events in order; Chautauqua
Text-Book No. 5, <i>Outline of Greek History;</i> Professor
Mahaffy's <i>Old Greek Life;</i> Stopford Brooke's
<i>Primer of English Literature;</i> Chautauqua Text-Book
No. 2, <i>Studies of the Stars;</i> Dr. H. W. Warren's
<i>Recreations in Astronomy;</i> J. Dorman Steele's
<i>Human Psychology;</i> Dr. J. F. Hurst's, <i>Outlines of
Bible History</i>, and <i>The Word of God Opened</i>, by
Rev. Bradford K. Pierce. This included no less
than eleven books, although four of them were the
small Chautauqua textbooks, Nos. 2, 4, 5, and 6.
All that was definitely required of the members
was that they should sign a statement that these
books had been read; but through the year a series
of sheets was sent to each enrolled member, containing
questions for examination, under the title
"Outline Memoranda," in order not to alarm
the unschooled reader by the terror of an examination.
Moreover, the student was at liberty to
search his books, consult any other works, and
obtain assistance from all quarters in obtaining the
answers to the questions. These questions were
of two kinds, one requiring thought on the part of
the reader, and not susceptible of answer at any
given page of the book; such as: "Name the
five persons whom you consider the greatest in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
the history of England, and the reasons for your
choice," "Name what you regard as five of the
most important events in English history," etc.
There were some other questions, of which the
answer might or might not be found in any books
of the books of the course, but questions to make
the reader search and enquire; such as: "What
did King John say when he signed Magna Charta?"
"With what words did Oliver Cromwell dismiss the
Long Parliament?" "What were the last words
of Admiral Nelson?" These questions brought
difficulty, not only to readers, but to school-teachers,
pastors, and librarians, to whom they
were propounded by puzzled students. At one
time I was reading of a convention of librarians,
where one of the subjects discussed was, how to
satisfy the hordes of Chautauquans everywhere,
asking all sorts of curious questions. The veterans
of that premier class of 1882 still remember the
sheet of the Outline Memoranda prepared by Dr.
Warren, on his book <i>Recreations in Astronomy</i>.
There may have been a member or two who succeeded
in answering them all, but their names
do not appear on any record.</p>

<p>Not all those, who in an hour of enthusiasm
under the spell of Dr. Vincent's address on that
opening day, wrote their names as members of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
C. L. S. C. persevered to the bitter end and won
the diploma. Of the 8400 enrolled in the first
class, only 1850 were "recognized" as graduates
in 1882. Some of the delinquents afterward took
heart of grace, and finished with later classes.
But even those who fell out by the way gained
something, perhaps gained an enduring impulse
toward good reading. We frequently received
word of those who had dropped the C. L. S. C. in
order to obtain a preparation for college. Dr.
Edward Everett Hale used to tell of a man whom
he met on a railway train, who made a remark
leading the doctor to say, "You talk like a Chautauquan&mdash;are
you a member of the C. L. S. C.?"
The man smiled and answered, "Well, I don't
know whether I am or not. My wife is: she read
the whole course, and has her diploma framed. I
read only one book, and then gave up. But any
institution that can lead a man to read Green's
<i>Short History of the English People</i>, has done
considerable for that man!"</p>

<p>As one by one the required books had been read
by diligent members, there came urgent requests
from many for the names of other books, on history,
on sciences, and especially on the Bible. Dr. Vincent
and his staff were compelled to look for the best
books on special courses, supplementing the required<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
course. By degrees almost a hundred of
these courses were arranged, and have been pursued
by multitudes. The one who read the
regular course through four years was to receive a
diploma; if he answered the questions of very
simple "Outline Memoranda," his diploma was
to bear one seal. If he took the stiffer "Outline
Memoranda" described above, his diploma was
to receive an additional seal for each year's work.
Each special course was to have its own special
seal. Any member who read the Bible through
while pursuing the course, would have a gold crown
seal upon his diploma. There were some elderly
people who seemed to have nothing in the world
to do, but to read special courses, fill out the memoranda,
send for seals, and then demand another
course on Crete or Kamchatka, or the Ten Lost
Tribes of Israel, until Miss Kimball, her helpers,
and her literary friends were kept on the jump to
find books on these various subjects. Hanging
on the walls of C. L. S. C. classrooms at Chautauqua
are diplomas illuminated with a hundred
seals or more, sent to the class headquarters as
memorials of diligent readers who have passed
away.</p>

<p>The readers of these seal-courses become members
of various "orders" of different rank. Those<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
whose diplomas show four seals belong to the
"Order of the White Seal," those who have seven
seals, to the "League of the Round Table," and if
they have fourteen seals or more, the "Guild of
the Seven Seals." Each of these societies holds
its annual reunion at Chautauqua, wears its own
badge, and marches behind its own banner in
the procession.</p>

<p>The reference to seals brings us to another
feature of Chautauqua, and especially of the C. L.
S. C., which attracted universal attention and led
many thousands into the charmed circle,&mdash;those
touches of poetry and sentiment, which no one but
Dr. Vincent could have originated. There were
the three mottoes of the C. L. S. C. always made
prominent in its prospectus and announcements,
"We Study the Word and the Works of God";
"Let Us Keep Our Heavenly Father in the Midst";
and "Never be Discouraged." The second of
these sentences was spoken by the venerable
Hebraist, Dr. Stephen H. Vail, as with tears upon
his face he parted with Dr. Vincent, at the session
of 1877, a year before the announcement of the
C. L. S. C. There was for each class a name.
The first class to take a name was that of '84,
established in 1880. They were continually calling
for class-meetings until Dr. Vincent in his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
announcements spoke of them as "those irrepressible
eighty-fours!" Whereupon they promptly
adopted as their name, "The Irrepressibles," and
their example was followed by the other classes.
The class of 1882 took the name, "The Pioneers."
Classes are known as "The Vincent Class," "The
Lewis Miller Class"&mdash;others are named after
Shakespeare, Tennyson, Sidney Lanier, etc. The
class graduating in 1892 commemorated the
discovery of America four hundred years before,
by the name "Columbia." Then, too, each class
has its own flower, which its members seek to
wear on the great days of the C. L. S. C.;
but only the Pioneer class of 1882 proudly
bears before it in procession a hatchet, and its
members wear little hatchets as badges. Dr.
Hale said that the reason why the Pioneers carry
hatchets is that "they axe the way!" Each
class has its own officers and trustees, and
though all its members are never assembled, and
can never meet each other, they maintain a strong
bond of union through correspondence. There
is the great silk banner of the Chautauqua Circle
leading the procession on Recognition Day,
followed by the classes from 1882 until the present,
each class marching behind its banner. In the
early days, until the Chautauqua grounds became<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
crowded, there was an annual "Camp Fire," all
the members in a great circle standing around a
great bonfire at night singing songs and listening
to short speeches. These are only a few of the
social influences which make the C. L. S. C. more
than merely a list of readers. It is a brotherhood,
a family bound together by a common interest.</p>

<p>The opening day of the Chautauqua readings is
October first. On that day at noon, the members
of the circle living at Chautauqua and others in
the adjacent towns meet at the Miller bell tower
on the Point. As the clock sounds out the hour
of twelve all present grasp a long rope connected
with the bells and together pull it, over and over
again, sounding forth the signal that the Chautauqua
year has begun. It is said that every true
Chautauquan the world over, from Mayville to
Hong-Kong, can hear the sound of that bell and
at the summons open their books for the year's
reading.</p>

<p>In one of the earlier years we received at the
office a letter from the wife of an army officer
stationed among the Indians, and far from any
settlement. She wrote that she was a hundred
and twenty-five miles from any other white
woman, and felt keenly her loneliness. But on
the day when her bundle of C. L. S. C. books<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
arrived, she clasped it to her bosom and wept tears
of joy over it, for she felt that she was no longer
alone, but one in a great company who were reading
the same books and thinking the same thoughts
and enjoying one fellowship.</p>

<p>In one of the early classes was a young lady who,
soon after sending in her name, sailed for South
Africa to become a teacher in a girl's boarding-school.
One day in the following June, when it
was in the depth of winter in South Africa,&mdash;for in
south latitude our seasons are reversed; they have
a saying at the Cape "as hot as Christmas"&mdash;she
came to her classes arrayed in her very best apparel.
The girls looked at her in surprise and asked
"Is this your birthday?"</p>

<p>"No," she answered, "but it is the Commencement
Day at Chautauqua in America, and everybody
dresses up on that day!"</p>

<p>The thousands of readers in the Chautauqua
fellowship naturally arranged themselves in two
classes. About half of them were reading by
themselves, individuals, each by himself or herself,&mdash;mostly
herself, for at least three-fourths of the
members were women, and their average age was
about thirty years. The other half were united
in groups, "local circles," as they were called.
Some of these were community circles, people of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
one village or town, irrespective of church relations;
other circles were connected with the
churches. In those days before the Christian
Endeavor Society, the Epworth League, and
other nation-wide organizations had appropriated
the interest of the young people, the Chautauqua
Circle was the literary society in many churches.</p>

<p>I recall the testimony of a Methodist minister
of those days, given to me when I met him at his
conference in the Middle West.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>When I was sent to my last church, I learned that
there was a reading circle among its members, and I
heard the news with some dismay, for in more than one
place I had started a literary society and found that it
was necessary for me to supply all the thought and
labor to keep it in operation, to plan the course, to
select people to write papers and persuade them to do
it, to be ready to fill vacancies on the program. And
as soon as I stopped supplying steam, the society was
sure to come to a stand-still. But at this church
I found a Chautauqua Circle that was taking care of
itself. Its programs were provided, the members
were reading a regular course and making their reports;
they presided in turn at the meetings, and I was not
called upon to take any part unless I desired it. Also
in the prayer-meetings, I could soon recognize the
members of the Circle by a touch of intelligence in
their testimonies.</p></div>

<p>It is the opinion of the writer that if one could
ascertain the history of the woman's clubs that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
now cover the country, and ascertain their origin,
it would be found that nearly all of the older
woman's clubs arose out of Chautauqua Circles
whose members, after completing the prescribed
course, took up civics or politics, or literature.
It would be an interesting study to ascertain how
far the General Federation of Women's Clubs of
America was an outgrowth of the Chautauqua
movement.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>

<h3>THE SCHOOL OF LANGUAGES</h3>



<p><span class="smcap">The</span> year 1879 marked an extension in more than
one direction of Chautauqua's plans and program.
The season was lengthened to forty-three days,
more than double the length of the earlier sessions.
On July 17th began the classes in The Chautauqua
Normal School of Languages, held in a rough board-walled,
white-washed building, which had formerly
been used as a lodging-house, but was no longer
needed since cottages had opened their doors to
guests. This may be regarded as the formal
opening of the Chautauqua Summer Schools, although
already classes had been held, some of them
three years, others four years, in Greek, Hebrew,
and kindergarten instruction. We will name the
faculty of this year. Greek was taught by a native
of Greece, Dr. T. T. Timayenis, of New York;
Latin by Miss Emma M. Hall, of the Detroit High
School, afterward a missionary-teacher in Rome,
Italy; Prof. J. H. Worman, of Brooklyn, N. Y.,
taught German, never speaking one word of English
in his classes, although a fluent speaker and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
author in English. Prof. A. Lalande was the
teacher of the French language; Dr. Stephen M.
Vail continued his classes in Hebrew, and Dr.
James Strong in Greek; Prof. Bernhard Maimon
of Chicago, taught Oriental languages; and Prof.
A. S. Cook, then of Johns Hopkins, but soon afterward
of Yale, conducted a class in the study of
Anglo-Saxon language and literature. These
studies were pursued from a fortnight before the
formal opening of the Assembly until its close,
making courses of six weeks, carried on in an intensive
manner. Each professor pushed his department
as though it were the only one in the school,
and his students could scarcely find time to rest
themselves by rowing on the lake or walking in the
woods with their classmates.</p>

<p>Allied to the School of Languages was the
Teachers' Retreat, opening at the same time but
closing just before the Assembly proper. This was
outside the realm of Sunday School instruction,
being intended for secular teachers and presenting
the principles and best methods of education. One
of its leaders was Prof. J. W. Dickinson, Secretary
of the Massachusetts State Board of Education,
an enthusiast as well as a master. He had at his
command a fund of witticisms and stories, always
in the direct line of his teaching, which added<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
not a little to the interest of his lectures. I was
with him at the table for a fortnight, and his juicy
talk made even a tough steak enjoyable. Associated
with Dr. Dickinson were Prof. William F.
Phelps of Minnesota, Dr. Joseph Alden of the
State Normal School, Albany, N. Y., and Dr. John
Hancock, President of the National Teachers'
Association. In the following year, 1880, the
School of Languages and Teachers' Retreat were
united, and the Summer School program was again
enlarged. Year by year new departments were
added, until Chautauqua became a summer university,
and such it continues to this day, offering
more than two hundred courses, taught by nearly
one hundred and fifty instructors. Perhaps the
most popular courses have always been those in
physical culture, pursued by teachers in public
and private schools, enabled by Chautauqua to
make their work in their home schools more efficient
and extensive. One might spend weeks at
Chautauqua, attending the lectures and concerts
in the Amphitheater and the Hall, and enjoying
the bathing and boating opportunities of the Lake,
yet never realizing that on College Hill, and down
at the Gymnasium, are nearly five thousand young
men and young women diligently seeking the
higher education.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>A third sideline during this season of 1879 was
the Foreign Mission Institute, held by missionary
leaders of the Congregational, Methodist, Presbyterian,
and Baptist organizations, and addressed
by missionaries at home from many lands. Chautauqua
was a pioneer in bringing together representatives
of different churches for conference upon
their work of winning the world to Christ. This
series of missionary councils has been continued
without the omission of a year through all the
history of Chautauqua since 1879.</p>

<p>The Sixth Chautauqua Assembly opened on its
regular evening, the first Tuesday in August, 1879.
The ravine which had been the seat of the Pavilion
and birthplace of the C. L. S. C. had been transformed
into a great auditorium of permanent
materials and fairly comfortable seats for five
thousand people. It was a great advance upon
any of the earlier meeting places, and made it no
longer necessary to carry one's umbrella to the
lectures. But a heavy rain on the extensive roof
would make even the largest-lunged orator inaudible,
and the many wooden pillars supporting
the roof had a fashion of getting themselves between
the speaker and the hearers. Notwithstanding
these minor drawbacks, it proved to be
one of the best audience-halls in the land for large<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
assemblies, for its acoustic properties were almost
perfect. No speaker ever heard his words flung
back to him by an echo, and the orator who knew
how to use his voice could be heard almost equally
well in every corner of the building. When Dr.
Buckley stood for the first time upon its platform,
and looked at its radiating and ascending
seats, he said to Dr. Vincent, "This is a genuine
<i>amphitheater</i>." The name was adopted, and the
Amphitheater became the meeting place for all
the popular lectures and the great Sunday services.
Many were the distinguished speakers, men and
women, who stood upon its platform, and as many
singers whose voices enraptured throngs. At a
popular concert almost as many seemed to be
standing, crowded under the eaves, as were seated
beneath the roof.</p>

<p>The old Amphitheater stood until 1897. In
that year the building of the Massey Memorial
Organ made some changes necessary. The old
building was taken down, and a new Amphitheater
arose in its place, having above it a trussed
roof and supported from the sides, and no pillars
obstructing the view. It has been said that the
Chautauqua Amphitheater will seat ten thousand
people, but a careful computation shows that fifty-five
hundred, or at the utmost fifty-six hundred<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
are its limit upon the benches, without chairs in
the aisles. But another thousand, or even fifteen
hundred may sometimes be seen standing back of
its seats at a popular lecture or concert.</p>

<p>In the season of 1879, one of the leading speakers
was an Englishman, the Rev. W. O. Simpson of
the Wesleyan Church, who had been for some
years a missionary in India. His graphic pictures
of village life in that land were a revelation, for
Kipling and his followers had not yet thrown the
light of their genius upon the great peninsula and
its people. Mr. Simpson was over six feet in
height and large in every way, in voice as well as
in girth. We all hoped to meet him yet many
years at Chautauqua, for he seemed to be abounding
in health. But a few months later we learned
of his sudden death. In those years it was the
Chautauqua custom to hold a memorial service for
men prominent in the class-room or on the platform,
and it fell to my lot to speak in 1880 upon
the Rev. W. O. Simpson. I sent to England for
printed matter relating to his life, and among the
appreciative articles found one story which is
worthy of remembrance.</p>

<p>When Mr. Simpson was a student of theology
at the Wesleyan Theological School, he chanced
one day to read the announcement of a lecture<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
upon the Bible, and went to hear it. To his amazement
he found himself at an infidel meeting, listening
to a virulent attack upon the Holy Scriptures.
In the middle of his lecture, the speaker said:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>There are undoubtedly good things in the Bible,
but anyone who is familiar with the ancient writers of
Greece, and especially those of India, knows well, if
he would tell the truth, that all the good things in the
Bible were stolen from earlier scholars and sages, and
were originally better spoken or written than by the
so-called authors of the Bible, who took them at
second-hand. If anybody here is prepared to deny
that statement, let him stand up and say so!</p></div>

<p>Instantly this young student of theology stood
up, six feet high, and at that time in his life very
slim in his figure. That he might be seen readily
he stood on the seat, and a fellow-student said that
he loomed up apparently ten feet high. He held
a little red-covered book, and stretching his long
arm toward the speaker, said something like this:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I hold in my hand a copy of the New Testament,
and I wish to say that in this little book, only a quarter
of the Bible, you will find a clearer light on man's
nature, and character, and destiny than may be read
in all the ancient books of the world taken together.</p></div>

<p>He paused, seized the little volume with both
hands, tore it in two parts, flung one part down to
the floor, and still holding the rest of it, went on:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I have thrown aside one-half of this book, but this
half contains the four gospels of our Lord, which will
tell more what man may be here and will be hereafter
than can be found in all the books of ancient Rome,
or Greece, or Chaldea, or India, or China.</p></div>

<p>Then he tore out three leaves from the fragment,
flung all the rest on the floor, and fluttering the
torn pages, said:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>These six pages contain Christ's Sermon on the
Mount, setting forth a higher standard of righteousness,
a clearer view of God, and a better knowledge of
man's nature than all the other ancient books on earth.
That is my answer to the speaker!</p></div>

<p>And leaving the torn book on the floor, he
walked out of the room.</p>

<p>Other speakers in the new Amphitheater in the
summer of 1879 were Dr. Henry W. Warren, in the
next year a Bishop; Frank Beard, with his caricatures
and stories; Dr. C. H. Fowler, Dr. Joseph
Cook, Bishop Foster, Dr. Alexander A. Hodge,
the Princeton theologian, Dr. John Lord, the historian,
Hon. J. W. Wendling of Kentucky, who
brought brilliant oratory to the service of Christianity
in an eloquent lecture on "The Man of
Galilee"; Prof. J. W. Churchill, one of the finest
readers of his time; Dr. George Dana Boardman
of Philadelphia; and Dr. Vincent himself, always<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
greeted by the largest audiences. Let us say, once
for all, that Dr. Buckley was a perennial visitor,
with new lectures every year, and his ever-popular
answers to the question-drawer. If there was a
problem which he could not solve, he could always
turn the tables on the questioner with a story
or a retort.</p>

<p>One event of 1879 not to be passed over was the
dedication of the Hall of Philosophy in St. Paul's
Grove. Dr. Vincent suggested the plan of the
building, to be set apart for the uses of the C. L.
S. C. and the interests of general culture. As
everybody who has been to Chautauqua knows, it
was in the form of a Greek temple, an open building
surrounded by plain columns, which may have
resembled marble, but were made of wood. The
dedication was held on August 5th, and addresses
were given by Dr. Vincent, Rev. W. O. Simpson,
and Dr. Ellinwood. There are thousands of
Chautauquans, some of them dwelling in distant
lands, who are ready to declare that in all the week,
the most precious hour was that of the five o'clock
Vesper Service on Sunday afternoon, when the
long rays of the setting sun fell upon the assemblage,
as they sang "Day is dying in the West,"
and they united in that prayer of Thomas &agrave;
Kempis, beginning, "In all things, O my soul, thou<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
shalt rest in the Lord always, for He is the everlasting
rest of the saints."</p>

<p>In the fall and winter of 1891 this writer was the
traveling companion of Bishop Vincent in Europe.
Every Sunday afternoon at five o'clock, whether
on the Atlantic, or in London, Lucerne, Florence,
or Naples, we brought out our copies of the vesper
service and read it together, feeling that in spirit
we were within the columns of that Hall in the
Grove.</p>

<p>This year, 1879, the second year of the C. L. S.
C., brought to its Founder a problem which threatened
the ruin of the circle, but in its happy solution
proved to be a powerful element in its success.
This was to be the Roman Year of the course, and
in the original conception the Pioneer Class of 1882
would take up Roman history, while the new class
of 1883 would begin as its predecessor had begun,
with English history. If this plan had been carried
out, as announced in the early circulars for that
year's study, then in every church and community
two classes must be organized and conducted
with different readings. Another year would require
three circles, and still another four circles.
Could members and leaders be found for four
separate clubs in one locality? Would not the
circle break up into fragments from the weight<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
of the machinery needed to keep the wheel in
motion? Just then came the suggestion&mdash;made
by President Lewis Miller, as Dr. Vincent told
me at the time&mdash;that <i>both</i> the classes should
read the books together, making the same course
the second year for the Pioneers, and the first
year's reading of "the Vincents," as the members
of '83 named themselves. In a college there is a
progression of studies, for one science must follow
another; but in the Chautauqua Circle, it makes
no difference whether the reader begins with the
history of Greece or of Rome, or of England, or of
America. New members can enter any year and
read with those already reading. The Circle is a
railroad train on a track with four stations. You
can board the train in England, America, or Greece
or Rome, and when you have gone the round and
reached the station where you began, you have
completed the course and receive your certificate
ornamented with all the seals that you have won
by additional reading and study. The present
four-year cycle of the C. L. S. C. consists of
the English, American, Classical, and Modern
European years.</p>

<p>One more event of 1879 must not be forgotten.
The Park of Palestine had fallen into decrepitude.
Some of its mountains had sunk down, and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
course of the River Jordan had become clogged up,
so there was danger of a lake at a spot where none
was on the map, and of a dry bed below, long after
the Israelites had finished their crossing. Moreover,
some mischievous boys had mixed up its
geography by moving a few of the cities. Bethel
was found where Kirjath-jearim should be; Joppa
had been swept by the ice in the breaking up of
winter into the Mediterranean Sea, and Megiddo
was missing. The task of reconstructing the Park
was given to Dr. W. H. Perrine of Michigan, a
scholar and an artist, who had traveled in the Holy
Land, had painted a panorama of it, and had constructed
a model in plaster. He rebuilt the Park
from more permanent materials, and succeeded in
making it more accurate in some details, as well as
more presentable in appearance. But man-made
mountains are by no means "the ever-lasting hills,"
and the Park of Palestine needs to be made over
at least once in ten years if it is to be kept worthy
of Chautauqua.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<h3>HOTELS, HEADQUARTERS, AND HAND-SHAKING<br />
(1880)</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> seventh session of the Assembly opened in
1880 with another addition to the Chautauqua
territory. Fifty acres along the Lake shore had
been acquired, and the Assembly-ground was now
three times as large as that of the old Fair Point
Camp Meeting.</p>

<p>This season saw also the foundation laid for a
large hotel. It is worthy of record that the Hotel
Athen&aelig;um was built not by the Assembly Board,
but by a stock company of people friendly to the
movement and willing to risk considerable capital
in its establishment. More than one promising
Assembly had already been wrecked and many
more were destined to bankruptcy by building
large hotels before they were assured of guests
to fill them. It must be kept in mind that
everywhere the Chautauqua constituency was not,
and is not now, the wealthy class who frequent
summer hotels and are willing to pay high prices for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
their entertainment. A Chautauqua Assembly,
whether in the east or the west, is mainly composed
of people possessing only moderate means, but
eager for intellectual culture. Whenever a Chautauqua
has been established in connection with
the conventional summer hotel, either it has become
bankrupt from lack of patronage, or the
hotel has swallowed up the Assembly. The Hotel
Athen&aelig;um at Chautauqua was not the property
of the Assembly, and might have failed&mdash;as many,
perhaps most, of the summer hotels at watering-places
have failed once or more than once in their
history&mdash;without endangering the Assembly itself.
The men who built the Athen&aelig;um, led by
Lewis Miller and his business partners, risked their
money, and might have lost it, for there were
seasons when it paid no dividends to the stockholders,
and other seasons when the profits were
small. Yet this hotel drew by degrees an increasing
number of visitors who were able and willing
to enjoy its advantages over those of the earlier
cottage boarding houses, and it led to better accommodations
and a more liberal table in the cottages,
until now the Hotel Athen&aelig;um is only one
of a number of really good houses of entertainment
at Chautauqua. It is given prominence in our
story because it was first in its field. By the way,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
the name "Hotel Athen&aelig;um" was given by Dr.
Vincent, who liked to impart a classical tone to
buildings in an educational institution.</p>

<p>The building was begun in 1880 and opened in
the following year, though even then not fully
completed. It occupied the site of a three-story
edifice bearing the high-sounding name "Palace
Hotel," a structure of tent-cloth over a wooden
frame, divided by muslin partitions, and three
stories in height. When rooms for the ever-increasing
multitudes at Chautauqua were few, the
Palace Hotel was a blessing to many visitors.
Some distinguished men slept in those tented
rooms, and inasmuch as a sheet partition is not
entirely sound-proof, their snores at night could
be heard almost as far as their speeches by day.
Some there were in the early eighties who shook
their heads as the walls of the new hotel rose, and
dreaded the tide of worldliness which would follow;
but the Hotel Athen&aelig;um has become a genuine
helper to the Chautauqua spirit, for its great parlor
has opened its doors to many receptions, and the
witty after-dinner speeches at banquets in its
dining-hall would fill more than one volume.</p>

<p>Another building which deserves mention is the
Congregational House, opened in 1880; the first
church headquarters established at Chautauqua.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
We have seen how the denominations were recognized
from the earliest years, and meeting places
provided for their prayer meetings and conferences.
The need was felt by a number of the
larger churches of a place where their members
could find a welcome on arrival, could form an
acquaintance with fellow-members, could meet
each other in social gatherings and prayer meetings,
and could promote the fraternal spirit.
The example of the Congregationalists was soon
followed. The Presbyterian headquarters, aided
by a liberal donation of Mr. Elliott F. Shepard of
New York, was the earliest brick building on the
ground, solid and substantial, befitting the church
which it represented. After a few years its size
was doubled to make a Mission House, where
missionaries of that church, home and foreign,
could enjoy a vacation at Chautauqua. The
Methodist House is one of the largest, for its chapel
is the home of the Community Church at Chautauqua
through the entire year, the church
home of the resident population of every denomination.
The Disciples of Christ, or Christian
Church, purchased a large boarding-house,
built before it a pillared porch, giving it a noble
frontage and furnishing rooms for guests in the
upper stories. The United Presbyterians built a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
chapel, serving also as a social room. The Protestant
Episcopalians also erected a chapel consecrated to
worship, but later established also a Church Home.
The Unitarians purchased and improved a property
fronting on St. Paul's Grove. The Baptists built
a large headquarters on Clark Avenue, the street
extending from the Amphitheater to the Hall of
Philosophy, and the Lutherans obtained a large
building near it. In all these Denominational
Houses there is an absence of clannish feeling. No
church uses its headquarters as a propaganda of its
peculiar views; and in the receptions fellow Christians
of every branch are always welcome. When
some eminent man comes to Chautauqua, his
church holds a reception in his honor, and everybody
who would like to take his hand flocks to the
meeting at his church headquarters. Speaking of
receptions, I must tell of one wherein I was supposed
to take a leading part, but found myself left
in the rear. Dr. Vincent announced that at four
o'clock, in the Hall of Philosophy, a reception
would be given to Dr. Edward Everett Hale. He
said to me:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Now, Dr. Hurlbut, I place this reception in your
hands to manage. Dr. Hale comes from Boston and
is accustomed to the formalities of the best society.
Be sure to have this reception held in the proper manner.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
Let the Doctor stand in front of the platform,
have ushers ready to introduce the people, and let
there be no indiscriminate handshaking.</p></div>

<p>I promised to see that everything should be done
decently and in order, and a few minutes before
the hour appointed, walked over to the Hall. I
was amazed to see a crowd of people, all pressing
toward the center, where the tall form of Dr. Hale
loomed above the throng, shaking hands apparently
in every direction. I rushed upon the
scene and vainly endeavored to bring about some
semblance of order. The reception was a tumultuous,
almost a rough-and-tumble, affair, everybody
reaching out for the guest in his own way. It came
about in this manner, as I learned.</p>

<p>Everybody at Chautauqua knows that the bell
invariably rings five minutes before the hour,
giving notice that the exercises may begin
promptly on the stroke of the clock. But Dr.
Hale did not know this, and when the five-minute
bell rang, he rose and said:</p>

<p>"The time for the meeting has come, but nobody
seems to be in charge. Let us begin the reception
ourselves without waiting."</p>

<p>He stood up, and began shaking hands right and
left, without waiting for introduction, and when
the four o'clock bell sounded, the reception was in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
full sweep, everybody crowding around at once and
grasping his hand. Before the first throng had
satisfied its desires, another stream poured in and
the general tumult continued until the five o'clock
hour compelled an adjournment, the Hall being
required for another meeting.</p>

<p>At the close, Dr. Hale remarked to me, "I especially
like the informality of such gatherings
here at Chautauqua. This has been one of the
most satisfactory receptions that I have ever
attended!"</p>

<p>Chautauqua was already coming to the front as
a convention-city. Its central location between
New York and Chicago, with ready transportation
north and south, its Amphitheater for great meetings,
with numerous halls and tents for smaller
gatherings and committees, the constant improvement
in its lodging and commissary departments,
its attractive program of lectures and entertainments,
and not the least, its romantic out-of-door
life, began to draw to the ground different
organizations. The Woman's Christian Temperance
Union, led by Frances E. Willard, returned
to its birthplace for its sixth annual convention,
and the National Educational Association brought
members from every State, presided over by Dr.
J. Ormond Wilson. This Association embraced<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
educators of widely diverging views, and some entertaining
scraps occurred in its discussions. For
example, the kindergarten instruction at Chautauqua
was under the direction of Madame Kraus-Boelte,
and her husband, a learned but rather
obstinate German, Professor Kraus. There was
an Americanized kindergarten, whose representative
came, hired a cottage, and hung out her sign,
but much to her displeasure was not allowed to
conduct classes. It would never answer to let
anybody hold classes unauthorized by the management,
for who could tell what educational
heresies might enter through the gate? But this
aggressive lady paid her fee, joined the N. E. A.,
and in the kindergarten section proceeded to exploit
her "improvements" upon the Froebel system.
This aroused the ire of Professor Kraus,
and in vigorous language he interrupted her
address, declaring, at first in English, then half in
German as his anger rose:</p>

<p>"Dat iss not kindergarten! Dere is but one
kindergarten! You can call dat whatever you
please, but not kindergarten! You can call it
joss-house, if you choose, but you must not say dat
mix-up is a kindergarten!"</p>

<p>The audience enjoyed the discussion all the more
because of this scramble between opposing schools.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<span class="caption">Disciples (Christian Church) Headquarters</span>
</div>

<p>There was another, and more dignified, controversy
on the Chautauqua platform in 1880. On
its program was the honored name of Washington
Gladden, of Columbus, Ohio, to speak upon
the Standard Oil Company and its misdeeds. A
friend of Dr. Vincent, who was an officer of the
Standard Oil, said that it would only be fair to hear
the other side, and proposed Mr. George Gunton
of New York as a speaker. So it came to pass
that two able men spoke on opposite sides of the
mooted question. Each gave an address and afterward
had an opportunity of answering the other's
arguments. So far as I know, this was the first
debate on public questions at Chautauqua, and it
was succeeded by many others. An effort is made
to have the burning questions of the time discussed
by representative speakers. Some exceedingly
radical utterances on capital and labor have
been made on the Chautauqua platform, but it
must not be inferred, because the audience listened
to them respectfully, or even applauded a particularly
sharp sentence, that Chautauqua was in
accord with the speaker's sentiments.</p>

<p>On the list of speakers at this season may be
read the following, a few among many names:
Prof. J. H. Gilmore of Rochester University gave a
series of brilliant lectures upon English literature.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
Ram Chandra Bose of India gave several lectures,
philosophic and popular. Dr. Sheldon Jackson of
Alaska thrilled a great audience with an appeal for
that outlying but unknown land of ours. Schuyler
Colfax, Vice-President of Grant's first administration,
gave a great lecture on "Abraham
Lincoln." Professor Borden P. Bowne of Boston
University made the deep things of philosophy
plain even to unphilosophic listeners. Other
orators in the new Amphitheater were Dr. Robert
R. Meredith of Boston, Dr. J. O. Means of the
American Board of Commissioners for Foreign
Missions, and Dr. W. W. Keen of Philadelphia.
The Fisk Jubilee Singers made their first visit this
year; and with the Northwestern Band and the
Assembly Chorus, already counted by the hundreds,
under Professors Sherwin and Case, made
music one of the most popular features of the
program.</p>

<p>This year was also notable for the first appearance
of the <i>Chautauquan Magazine</i>, containing a
part of the required readings of the C. L. S. C.
It was launched and made successful by the financial,
business, and editorial ability of Dr. Flood,
who ventured his capital boldly and won deserved
success. The ever-welcome "Pansy," Mrs. G. R.
Alden, this season read a new story, published soon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
afterward. With Mrs. Alden in those early years
was a serious small boy, ever at his mother's side,
rarely entering into the sports of childhood. If we
could have looked forward a quarter-century, we
might have seen in him the coming Professor
Raymond M. Alden of the Leland Stanford
faculty, one of the most eminent scholars and
critics in the Department of English Literature,
and an authority quoted in all lands where the
English language is spoken or read.</p>

<p>A visitor came to Chautauqua at the session of
1880, whose presence brought the place and the
Assembly into notice throughout the nation.
General James A. Garfield was at that time the
candidate of his party for President of the United
States. He came to Chautauqua on Saturday,
August 7th, for a week-end rest in a strenuous
campaign, expressing a wish not to be called upon
for any public address or reception. He worshiped
with the great congregation on Sunday
morning, his entrance with a group of his friends
being received in respectful silence. In the afternoon
he mentioned to Dr. Vincent that he had
heard of Palestine Park and would like to visit
it. As the lectures in the Park were generally
given by me, I was detailed to walk through the
model and point out its localities. As we went<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
out of Dr. Vincent's tent a small company was
standing around, waiting for a sight of the candidate.
They followed us, and as we walked on
toward the Park, people came flocking forth from
every house and tent. By the time we reached
the Land of Palestine, it was well-nigh covered
with the crowds, extending from Dan to Beersheba.
No former Palestine lecture of mine had
ever drawn together such a multitude! It became
impossible to find the cities covered by the
multitudes. But I was somewhat surprised to
perceive that the General knew where at least the
important localities belonged even though they
were not visible. He pointed out half a dozen of
the cities named in the Bible, and gave their names
without hesitation or suggestion. We desired to
make a sort of pilgrimage through the land, but
found an army obstructing our journey.</p>

<p>On the next morning, as General Garfield was
about to leave, Dr. Vincent asked him, not to make
a political speech, but to give in a few words his
impressions of Chautauqua. He consented, and
standing upon a stump, in the presence of a hastily
assembled gathering, gave a ten-minute address,
of which the following is a part.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>You are struggling with one of the two great problems
of civilization. The first one is a very old<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
struggle: It is, how shall we get any leisure? That is
the problem of every hammer stroke, of every blow
that labor has struck since the foundation of the world.
The fight for bread is the first great primal fight, and
it is so absorbing a struggle that until one conquers it
somewhat he can have no leisure whatever. So that
we may divide the whole struggle of the human race
into two chapters; first, the fight to get leisure; and
then the second fight of civilization&mdash;what shall we
do with our leisure when we get it? And I take it
that <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Chautuaqua'">Chautauqua</ins> has assailed the second problem.
Now, leisure is a dreadfully bad thing unless it is well
used. A man with a fortune ready made and with
leisure on his hands, is likely to get sick of the world,
sick of himself, tired of life, and become a useless,
wasted man. What shall you do with your leisure?
I understand Chautauqua is trying to answer that
question and to open out fields of thought, to open out
energies, a largeness of mind, a culture in the better
senses, with the varnish scratched off. We are getting
over the process of painting our native woods and
varnishing them. We are getting down to the real
grain, and finding whatever is best in it and truest in
it. And if <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Chautuaqua'">Chautauqua</ins> is helping garnish our people
with the native stuff that is in them, rather than with
the paint and varnish and gew-gaws of culture, they
are doing well.</p></div>

<p>As we looked upon that stately figure, the form
of one born to command, and listened to that mellow,
ringing voice, no one dreamed that within a
year that frame would be laid low, that voice<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
hushed, and that life fraught with such promise
ended by an assassin's bullet!</p>

<p>The Assembly of 1880 came to its close on
August 19th, after a session of thirty-eight days.
Although the C. L. S. C. had come to the foreground
and held the center of the stage, the normal
work and Bible study had not been neglected.
The teacher-training classes were now under the
charge of Dr. Richard S. Holmes and Rev. J. L.
Hurlbut. The Children's Class was maintained
with a daily attendance approaching three hundred,
the lessons taught by Rev. B. T. Vincent and
pictures drawn by Frank Beard; also Mr. Vincent
conducted an Intermediate Class in Bible Study.
In all these classes for older and younger students,
more than two hundred and fifty passed the
examination and were enrolled as graduates.</p>

<p>On the last evening of the Assembly, after the
closing exercises, there was seen a weird, ghostly
procession, in white raiment, emerging from the
Ark and parading solemnly through the grounds,
pausing before the Miller Cottage and the Vincent
Tent for a mournful, melancholy musical strain.
This was the "ghost walk" of the guests in the
Ark. Some eminent Doctors of Divinity and
Ph.D.'s were in that sheeted procession, led by
Professors Sherwin and Case, engineered, as such<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
functions were apt to be, by Frank and Helen
Beard. The ghost walk grew into an annual
march, until it was succeeded by a more elaborate
performance, of which the story will be told later.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<h3>DEMOCRACY AND ARISTOCRACY AT CHAUTAUQUA<br />(1881)</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> eighth session opened on Thursday, July
7th, and continued forty-seven days to August
22d. A glance over the program shows that among
the lecturers of that year was Signor Alessandro
Gavazzi, the founder of the Free Italian Church,
whose lectures, spiced with his quaint accent, and
emphasized by expressive shoulders, head, glance
of eye, held the interest of his auditors from the
opening sentence to the end. No verbal report,
however accurate, can portray the charm of
this wonderful Italian. Professor W. D. McClintock
of the University of Chicago, gave a
course on literature, analytic, critical, and suggestive.
Dr. William Hayes Ward, Dr. Daniel
A. Goodsell, afterward a Methodist Bishop, Professor
Charles F. Richardson, Dr. Edward Everett
Hale, Dr. A. E. Dunning, Editor of <i>The Congregationalist;</i>
General O. O. Howard, who told war
stories in a simple, charming manner; Dr. Philip<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
Schaff, one of the most learned yet most simple-hearted
scholars of the age; Dr. A. A. Willetts, with
his many times repeated, yet always welcome lecture
on "Sunshine," were among the men whose
voices filled the Amphitheater during the season.
The Fisk Jubilee Singers were with us again and
Signor Giuseppe Vitale made the birds sing
through his wonderful violin.</p>

<p>The success of the C. L. S. C., which was widening
its area every month, inspired Dr. Vincent to
look for new fields to conquer. He established
this year the C. Y. F. R. U., initials standing for
The Chautauqua Young Folks Reading Union,
which proposed to do for the boys and girls what
the Reading Circle was accomplishing for men and
women. But it was found after a few years of
trial that the school-age seeks its own reading and
is not responsive to direction in literature on a
vast scale, for the C. Y. F. R. U. was not successful
in winning the young readers.</p>

<p>Another scheme launched this year met with the
same fate;&mdash;The Chautauqua School of Theology.
It was thought that many ministers who had not
received a theological education would avail themselves
of an opportunity to obtain it while in the
pastorate. This was to be not a course of reading,
but of close study, under qualified instruction in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
each department, with examinations, a diploma,
and a degree. But it required more thorough
study and much larger fees than a mere course of
reading, and those who needed it most were often
the poorest paid in their profession. It did not
receive the support needful for its success, it had
no endowment, and after an experiment extending
through a number of years, it was reluctantly
abandoned. Some of us have believed that if the
Chautauqua Correspondence School of Theology
could have found friends to give it even a moderate
endowment, it might have supplied an education
needed by a multitude of ministers.</p>

<p>The Hotel Athen&aelig;um was opened in 1881 and
speedily filled with guests. It aided in bringing
to Chautauqua a new constituency and also
spurred the cottage boarding-houses to improve
their accommodations and their fare. From the
beginning the waiters and other helpers at the
Hotel, and also in the cottages, have been mostly
young people seeking to obtain higher education,
and paying their way at Chautauqua by service.
I remember one morning finding a Hebrew book
on my breakfast table. One meets unaccustomed
things at Chautauqua, but I was quite sure the
<i>menu</i> was not in that language. I called the attention
of the young man who brought in the breakfast<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
to the book. He told me that he was studying
Hebrew with Dr. Harper, and from time to
time we had some conversation concerning his
college work. Twenty years afterward I met a
prominent Methodist minister at a Conference,
who said to me, "Don't you remember me, Dr.
Hurlbut? I used to wait on your table at Chautauqua
and we talked together about Hebrew."
That minister was a member of several General
Conferences and some years ago was made one of
the Bishops in his church.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ida B. Cole, the Executive Secretary of
the C. L. S. C., is responsible for the following: A
woman once said, "Chautauqua cured me of being
a snob, for I found that my waitress was a senior in
a college, the chambermaid had specialized in
Greek, the porter taught languages in a high
school, and the bell-boy, to whom I had been
giving nickel tips, was the son of a wealthy family
in my own State who wanted a job to prove his
prowess."</p>

<p>There are a few, however, who do not take
kindly to the democratic life of Chautauqua. I
was seated at one of the hotel tables with a well-known
clergyman from England, whose sermons
of a highly spiritual type are widely read in
America; and I remarked:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p>"Perhaps it may interest you to know that all
the waiters in this hotel are college-students."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" he said, "surely no college
student would demean himself by such a
servile occupation! But it may be a lark, just
for fun."</p>

<p>"No," I answered, "they are men who are
earning money to enable them to go on with their
college work, a common occurrence in summer
hotels in America."</p>

<p>Said this minister, "Well, I don't like it; and it
would not be allowed in my country. No man
after it could hold up his head in an English University
or College. I don't enjoy being waited
on by a man who considers himself my social
equal!"</p>

<p>Other eminent Englishmen did not agree with
this clergyman. When I mentioned this incident
a year later to Principal Fairbairn of Oxford, he
expressed his hearty sympathy with the democracy
shown at Chautauqua, and said that whatever
might be the ideas of class-distinction in English
colleges, they were unknown in Scotland, where
some of the most distinguished scholars rose from
the humblest homes and regardless of their poverty
were respected and honored in their colleges.</p>

<p>Dr. Vincent, ever fertile in sentimental touches,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
added two features to the usages of the C. L. S. C.
One was the "Camp fire." In an open place a
great bonfire was prepared; all the members stood
around in a circle, clasping hands; the fire was
kindled, and while the flames soared up and lit the
faces of the crowd, songs were sung and speeches
were made. This service was maintained annually
until the ground at Chautauqua became too closely
occupied by cottages for a bonfire to be safe. It
is noteworthy that on the day after the camp fire,
there was always a large enrollment of members
for the C. L. S. C. Of course, the camp fire
was introduced at other Assemblies, by this time
becoming numerous, and it attracted not only
spectators, but students to the reading-course.
At our first camp fire in the Ottawa Assembly,
Kansas, an old farmer from the country rushed
up to Dr. Milner, the President, and said:</p>

<p>"I don't know much about this ere circle you
were talking about, but I'm going to jine, and
here's my fifty cents for membership and another
for my wife."</p>

<p>There were only twenty members around the
fire that night, but on the next day, there were
forty or more on the registry at the Chautauqua
tent.</p>

<p>The camp fire died down after a number of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
years, but the Vigil, also introduced in 1881, became
a permanent institution. In the days of
chivalry, when a youth was to receive the honor of
knighthood, he spent his last night in the chapel
of the castle, watching beside his armor, to be worn
for the first time on the following day. Dr.
Vincent called upon the members of the Pioneer
class of the C. L. S. C., destined to graduate on the
following year, to meet him in the Hall of Philosophy
late on Sunday night, after the conclusion
of the evening service. All except members of
the class were requested not to come. The hall
was dimly lighted, left almost in darkness. They
sang a few songs from memory, listened to a Psalm,
and to an earnest, deeply religious address, were
led in prayer, and were dismissed, to go home in
silence through the empty avenues. After a few
years the Vigil was changed from a Sunday evening
of the year before graduation to the Sunday
immediately preceding Recognition Day, for the
reason that on the graduation year, the attendance
of any class is far greater than on the year before.
The Vigil is still one of the time-honored and highly
appreciated services of the season. Now, however,
the Hall is no longer left in shadow, for
around it the Athenian Watch Fires lighten up
St. Paul's Grove with their flaring tongues. Generally<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
more people are standing outside the pillars
of the Hall, watching the ceremonials, than are
seated before the platform, for none are permitted
to enter except members of the class about to
graduate.</p>

<p>I am not sure whether it was in this year, 1881,
or the following that Dr. Vincent inaugurated
the Society of Christian Ethics. This was not an
organization with a roll of membership, dues, and
duties, but simply a meeting on Sunday afternoon
in the Children's Temple, at which an address on
character was given, in the first years by Dr.
Vincent. It was especially for young people of
the 'teen age. No one was admitted under the
age of twelve or over that of twenty. The young
people were quite proud of having Dr. Vincent all
to themselves, and strongly resented the efforts
of their elders to obtain admittance. No person
of adult years was allowed without a card signed
by Dr. Vincent. These addresses by the Founder,
if they had been taken down and preserved, would
have formed a valuable book for young people on
the building up of true character. They were
continued during the years of Dr. Vincent's active
association with Chautauqua and for some time
afterward; addresses being given by eminent men
of the Chautauqua program. But very few<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
speakers could meet the needs of that adolescent
age. By degrees the attendance decreased and
after some years the meeting gave place to other
interests.</p>

<p>The regular features of the season went on as in
other years. The schools were growing in students,
in the number of instructors, and in the
breadth of their courses. The Sunday School
Normal Department was still prominent, and on
August 17, 1881, one hundred and ninety diplomas
were conferred upon the adults, intermediates, and
children who had passed the examination.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<h3>THE FIRST RECOGNITION DAY<br />
(1882)</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> opening service of the ninth session was
begun, as all the opening sessions of previous years,
in the out-of-doors Auditorium in front of the
Miller Cottage. But a sudden dash of rain came
down and a hasty adjournment was made to the
new Amphitheater. From 1882 onward, "Old
First Night" has been observed in that building. A
few lectures during the season of '82 were given in
the old Auditorium, but at the close of the season
the seats were removed, save a few left here and
there under the trees for social enjoyment; and
the Auditorium was henceforth known as Miller
Park.</p>

<p>The crowning event of the 1882 season was the
graduation of the first class in the Chautauqua
Literary and Scientific Circle. Taking into account
the fact that it was the first class, for which
no advertising had been given and no announcement
made in advance, the number graduated at
the end of the four years was remarkably large,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
over eighteen hundred, of which eight hundred
received their diplomas at Chautauqua and a
thousand more at their homes, some in distant
places. Years afterward I met a minister in a
small town in Texas who had seen the report of
the inauguration of the C. L. S. C., had read Dr.
Vincent's address on that occasion, and joined
the Class of 1882, its only member, as far as he
knew, in his State. One member was a teacher in
South Africa, others were missionaries in India
and China. Most of the regular visitors to Chautauqua
in those early days were members of this
class, so that even now, after nearly forty years, the
Pioneer Class can always muster at its annual
gatherings a larger number of its members than
almost any other of the classes. For many years
Mrs. B. T. Vincent was the President of the Class,
and strongly interested in its social and religious
life. She instituted at Chautauqua the "Quiet
Hour," held every Saturday evening during the
Assembly season, at Pioneer Hall, by this class,
a meeting for conversation on subjects of culture
and the Christian life. It is a touching sight to
look upon that group of old men and women, at
their annual farewell meeting, on the evening before
the Recognition Day, standing in a circle with
joined hands, singing together their class song<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
written for them by Mary A. Lathbury, and then
sounding forth their class yell:</p>

<div class='poem'>
Hear! Hear! Pioneers!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Height to height, fight for right,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Pioneers!</span><br />
Who are you? Who are you?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">We are the class of eighty-two!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Pioneers&mdash;Ah!</span><br />
</div>

<p>No college class was ever graduated with half
the state and splendor of ceremony that was observed
on that first Recognition Day, in a ritual
prepared by Dr. Vincent, and observed to the
letter every year since 1882. He chose to call it
not a Commencement, but a Recognition, the
members of the Circle being <i>recognized</i> on that
day as having completed the course and entitled
to membership in the Society of the Hall in the
Grove, the Alumni Association of the C. L. S. C.</p>

<p>A procession was formed, its divisions meeting
in different places. The graduating class met
before the Golden Gate at St. Paul's Grove, a gate
which is opened but once in the year and through
which none may pass except those who have completed
the course of reading and study of the C. L.
S. C. Over the gate hung a silk flag which had
been carried by the Rev. Albert D. Vail of New
York to many of the famous places in the world of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
literature, art, and religion. It had been waved
from the summit of the Great Pyramid, of Mount
Sinai in the Desert, and Mount Tabor in the Holy
Land. It had been laid in the Manger at Bethlehem,
and in the traditional tomb of Jesus in Holy
Sepulcher Church. It had fluttered upon the Sea
of Galilee, upon Mount Lebanon, in the house
where Paul was converted at Damascus, and under
the dome of St. Sophia in Constantinople. It had
been at the Acropolis and Mars' Hill in Athens, to
Westminster Abbey, and to Shakespeare's tomb
at Stratford, to the graves of Walter Scott and
Robert Burns. Upon its stripes were inscribed
the names of forty-eight places to which that flag
had been carried. The class stood before the
Golden Gate, still kept closed until the moment
should come for it to be opened, and in two sections
the members read a responsive service from the
Bible, having wisdom and especially the highest
wisdom of all, the knowledge of God, as its subject.</p>

<p>At the same time one section of the parade was
meeting in Miller Park, in front of the Lewis Miller
Cottage. Another was at the tent where lived
Dr. Vincent, and still another division, the most
interesting of all, on the hill, in front of the Children's
Temple. This was an array of fifty little
girls in white dresses, with wreaths in their hair<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
and baskets of flowers in their hands. At the
signal, the procession moved from its different
stations, and marched past the Vincent Tent, led
by the band and the flower girls, and including
every department of Chautauqua, officials, trustees,
schools, and Sunday School Normal Class.
In the later years each class of graduates marched,
led by its banner, the Class of 1882, the Pioneers,
bearing in front their symbol, the hatchet. Before
all was the great banner of the C. L. S. C. presented
to the Circle by Miss Jennie Miller, Lewis Miller's
eldest daughter, bearing upon one side a painting
of the Hall of Philosophy and the three mottoes of
the Circle; on the other a silk handkerchief which
had accompanied the flag on its journey to the
sacred places. The pole holding up the banner was
surmounted by a fragment of Plymouth Rock.</p>

<p>The march was to the Hall of Philosophy, where
the orator, officers, and guests occupied the platform,
the little flower girls were grouped on opposite
sides of the path from the Golden Gate up
to the Hall; the graduating class still standing
outside the entrance protected by the Guard of
the Gate. A messenger came from the Gate to
announce that the class was now prepared to enter,
having fulfilled all of the conditions, and the order
was given, "Let the Golden Gate now be opened."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
The portals were swung apart, and the class entered,
passing under the historic flag and successively
under four arches dedicated respectively to
Faith, Science, Literature, and Art, while the little
girls strewed flowers in their path. As they
marched up the hill they were greeted by Miss
Lathbury's song:</p>

<div class='center'>THE SONG OF TO-DAY</div>

<div class='poem'>
Sing p&aelig;ans over the Past!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">We bury the dead years tenderly,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To find them again in eternity,</span><br />

<br />
Farewell, farewell to the Old!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Beneath the arches, and one by one,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From sun to shade, and from shade to sun,</span><br />
We pass, and the years are told.<br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To faith that follows, to feet that pass</span><br />
Forth into the great TO BE<br />
The Lord shall sever the sea!<br />
</div>

<p>The inspiring music of this inspiring hymn was
composed, like most of the best Chautauqua songs,
by Prof. William F. Sherwin. The class entered,
and while taking their seats were welcomed in the
strains of another melody:</p>

<div class='poem'>
A song is thrilling through the trees,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And vibrant through the air,</span><br />
Ten thousand hearts turn hitherward,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And greet us from afar.</span><br />
And through the happy tide of song<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That blends our hearts in one,</span><br />

<div class='center'><span class="smcap">Chorus</span></div>

<div class='poem'>
Then bear along, O wings of song,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Our happy greeting glee,</span><br />

Till that fair day, clasp hands, and say<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">God bless us, every one! <i>Chorus.</i></span><br />
</div>

<p>Another responsive service followed, read in
turn by the Superintendent and the class, and then
Dr. Vincent gave the formal Recognition in words
used at every similar service since that day:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<div class='center'>
<i>Fellow-Students of the Chautauqua Literary and Scientific Circle.</i><br />
</div>

<span class="smcap">Dearly Beloved</span>:

<p>You have finished the appointed and accepted course
of reading; you have been admitted to this sacred
Grove; you have passed the arches dedicated to Faith,
Science, Literature, and Art; you have entered in due
form this Hall, the center of the Chautauqua Literary
and Scientific Circle. And now as Superintendent of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
Instruction,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> with these my associates, the counsellors
of our Fraternity, I greet you; and hereby announce
that you, and your brethren and sisters absent from
us to-day, who have completed with you the prescribed
course of reading, are accepted and approved
graduates of the Chautauqua Literary and Scientific
Circle, and that you are entitled to membership in the
Society of the Hall in the Grove. "The Lord bless
thee and keep thee; the Lord make his face shine upon
thee, and be gracious unto thee; the Lord lift up his
countenance upon thee and give thee peace."</p></div>

<p>After another song, the Marshal of the procession
took charge, and the order of march was renewed,
the newly graduated class in the rear,
followed by the Superintendent, Counsellors, and
officers. The company marched to the Amphitheater,
on the way the procession dividing and
forming on both sides of the street, while the
officers and the graduating class passed through
the open files, thus bringing the graduating class
at the head of the line into the Amphitheater.
Here more songs were sung and other responsive
readings were rendered before an audience that
thronged the building. The oration on the first
graduation service was given by Dr. Henry W.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
Warren, who had been elevated to the episcopate
two years before. After the oration a recess was
taken, and in the afternoon the concluding service
was held and the diplomas were conferred upon
the eight hundred graduates present by the hand
of Dr. Vincent.</p>

<p>In most college commencements that I have attended,
the President takes the diplomas at random
from a table and hands them to the class as
they come, not giving to each graduate his own
diploma, and afterward there is a general looking
up one another and sorting out the diplomas until
at last each one obtains his own. But Miss
Kimball, the Secretary, devised a plan by which
all the diplomas were numbered and each graduate
was furnished with a card showing his number.
These numbers were called out ten at a time, and
each graduate was able to receive his own (mostly
<i>her</i> own) diploma, while the audience heard the
name upon it and the number of seals it bore for
special reading and study.</p>

<p>It should be mentioned that some members of
the class arrived on the ground too late to pass
with their classmates through the Golden Gate and
under the arches. For their benefit the Gate was
opened a second time before the afternoon meeting,
and a special Recognition service was held,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
so that they might enjoy all the privileges of the
class. This is another custom continued every
year, for always it is needed.</p>

<p>After a year or two it entered the facetious
minds of Mr. and Mrs. Beard to originate a comic
travesty on the Recognition service, which was
presented on the evening after the formal exercises,
when everybody was weary and was ready to descend
from the serious heights. This grew into
quite an institution and was continued for a number
of years&mdash;a sort of mock-commencement,
making fun of the prominent figures and features
of the day. Almost as large an audience was wont
to assemble for this evening of mirth and jollity,
as was seen at the stately service of the morning.
This in turn had its day and finally grew into the
Chautauqua Circus, an amateur performance
which is still continued every year under one name
or another.</p>

<p>We have given much space to the story of the
first Recognition Day, as a sample of the similar
services held every year afterward, growing with
the growth of the C. L. S. C. But there were
other events of '82 scarcely less noteworthy. On
that year a great organ was installed in the Amphitheater,
and its effect was soon seen in the enlargement
of the choir and the improvement in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
music. We can mention only in the briefest manner
some of the speakers on the platform for
that year: such as Dr. W. T. Harris of Concord,
Mass., afterward U. S. Commissioner of Education;
Professor William H. Niles of Boston; Mr.
Wallace Bruce; Dr. T. DeWitt Talmage; Dr.
Wm. M. Blackburn of Cincinnati, the church
historian; Dr. A. D. Vail of New York, who told
in an interesting manner the story of the banner
and the flag; Dr. Mark Hopkins, the great college
President; Bishop R. S. Foster; Anthony Comstock
and John B. Gough, with others equally distinguished
whose names we must omit. One new
name appeared upon the program of this season
which will be read often in the coming years, that
of Mr. Leon H. Vincent, the son of Rev. B. T.
Vincent. He gave a course of lectures on English
literature, mingling biographical, social, and critical
views of the great writers, attracting large audiences.
We shall find him among the leading lights
of Chautauqua in the successive chapters of our
story.</p>

<p>An institution which began that year and has
been perpetuated must not be omitted&mdash;the Devotional
Conference. Both of the Founders of
Chautauqua were strong in their purpose to hold
the Christian religion ever in the forefront at the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
Assembly. Various plans were tried during the
early years, but none seemed to reach the constituency
of Chautauqua until Dr. Benjamin M.
Adams, at Dr. Vincent's request, began holding a
daily service of an hour. This attracted a large
attendance and was continued for a number of
years, as long as Dr. Adams could conduct it.
Afterward an arrangement was made which has
become permanent. Every season a series of
eminent clergymen are engaged, each to serve for
one week as chaplain. He preaches the Sunday
morning sermon in the Amphitheater, and on the
following five days at ten o'clock conducts the
Devotional Hour in the same place, giving a series
of discourses, Bible readings, or addresses. The
speaker of each week is a man of national or international
fame. The greatest preachers in the
American pulpit have spoken at this service, and
the audience is surpassed in numbers only by the
most popular lectures or concerts. Many there
are who deem this the most precious hour in the
day.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<h3>SOME STORIES OF THE C. L. S. C.<br />
(1883, 1884)</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">We</span> must hasten our steps through the passing
years at Chautauqua. Our readers may take for
granted that the regular departments were continued;
that the Summer Schools were adding
new courses and calling new professors; that the
Normal Class for the training of Sunday School
workers was still held, no longer in the section-tents
nor in the Children's Temple, but under a
large tent on an elevation where two years later
was to stand the Normal Hall, built for the class,
but after some years transferred first to the Musical
Department, later to the Summer Schools
and partitioned into class-rooms. The Children's
Class was still held by Dr. B. T. Vincent and
Professor Frank Beard, for our friend with the
crayon was now in the faculty of the School of Art
in Syracuse University.</p>

<p>In 1883 the session was forty-five days long,
from July 14th to August 27th. A new feature of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
the program was an "Ideal Foreign Tour through
Europe," with illustrated lectures on various cities
by C. E. Bolton, and "Tourists' Conferences"
conducted by his wife, the cultured Mrs. Sarah K.
Bolton. Mrs. Emma P. Ewing of Chicago taught
classes in the important art of cookery. Professor
Charles J. Little gave a course of lectures. Hon.
Albion W. Tourgee, residing at Mayville, who had
achieved fame soon after the Civil War by his story,
<i>A Fool's Errand</i>, gave lectures in the Amphitheater.
Professor William C. Richards showed brilliant illustrations
in physical science. Dr. P. S. Henson
entertained while he instructed; President Julius
H. Seelye, Dr. W. F. Mallalien, later a Bishop,
President Joseph Cummings of Northwestern
University, Hon. Will Cumback of Indiana, and
many others, gave lectures.</p>

<p>A new instructor entered the School of Languages
in 1883, in the person of William Rainey
Harper, then Professor in the Baptist School of
Theology at Morgan Park, Illinois, afterward to
be the first President of the University of Chicago.
No man ever lived who could inspire a class with
the enthusiasm that he could awaken over the
study of Hebrew, could lead his students so far in
that language in a six weeks' course, or could
impart such broad and sane views of the Biblical<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
literature. From this year Dr. Harper was one of
the leaders at Chautauqua, and soon was advanced
to the principalship of the Summer Schools.
In the after years, while Dr. Harper was President
of the University of Chicago, and holding classes
all the year, in summer as well as winter, he
was wont to take the train every Friday afternoon,
in order to spend Saturday and Sunday at
Chautauqua. Chautauquans of those days will
also remember the recitals by Professor Robert L.
Cumnock of Northwestern University, a reader
who was a scholar in the best literature.</p>

<p>The class of 1883, though not as large as its predecessor,
the Pioneers, was graduated with the
same ceremonies, the address on Recognition
Day given by Dr. Lyman Abbott of New York,
one of the Counsellors of the Circle. Five years
had now passed since the inauguration of this
movement, and from every quarter testimonials
of its power and incidents showing its influence
were received. Let me mention a few of these
which came under my own notice.</p>

<p>I met a lady who mentioned that she and her
husband were reading the course together and they
found the only available hour between six and
seven in the morning, before breakfast. For the
study of the course they both had risen at half past<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
five for a year or more. One result of this early
morning reading was, she said, that at the breakfast
table they told the children stories of history
and science, which she thought turned their minds
toward knowledge. Among the books was one
on Human Physiology&mdash;a book, which, by the
way, I did not rate very highly and objected to as
being so elementary as to become almost juvenile;
yet that book awakened such an interest that the
lady began to read more widely and deeply on the
subject, after a few months entered the Woman's
Medical College in New York, during her course
took several prizes, and graduated with high
honors. It may have been that she foresaw what
came, the failure of her husband's health, so that
of necessity she became the bread-winner for
her family. She was a successful physician,
honored in the community, the Chautauqua Circle
having opened to her wider opportunities of
knowledge and usefulness.</p>

<p>Two college professors of high standing have
told me that they were first awakened to a desire
and determination for higher education through
their early readings in the C. L. S. C.</p>

<p>One rather amusing yet suggestive incident came
to my notice. Visiting a city in the Middle West,
I met a lady who told me that she belonged to a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
club of young people who met weekly in a card
party. One member told the rest about the C. L.
S. C. which she had joined and showed them the
books, whereupon they all sent in their names as
members, and the card club was transformed into
a Chautauqua Reading Circle.</p>

<p>I was seated with Dr. Edward E. Hale at a C. L.
S. C. banquet in New England, when he pointed
out a middle-aged gentleman at the head of one
of the tables and told me this story about him.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>While a boy he came to his father and said, "I don't
want to go to school any longer, I want to go to work
and earn my own living, and there's a place in Boston
that is open to me." "Well," said his father, "perhaps
you would better take the place, I've noticed that you
are not paying much attention to your studies of late.
I'm very sorry for I have set my heart on giving you
a good education. You don't know now, but you'll
find out later that the difference between the man who
gives orders and the man who takes them is that
generally one of the two men knows more than the
other, and knowledge brings a man up in the world."
The boy went to Boston and took a job in a big store,
and he found that he was taking a good many orders
from those above him and giving none to others. He
realized that for success in life he needed an education.
Ashamed to give up and go home, he began to attend
an evening school which some of us had established.
There I met him and was able to give him some encouragement
and some help. He became a well-read<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
and, in the end, a successful business man. As soon
as he heard of the Chautauqua Circle, he began to
read its books and was made President of a local circle.
That table is filled with the members of his circle and
he sits at the head of it.</p></div>

<p>I wish that I could write down a story as it was
told me by Dr. Duryea, at Chautauqua. It was of
a man who sat at his table in the Hotel and was
always in a hurry, never finishing his meals in his
haste to get to lectures and classes. The Doctor
got him to talking and he forgot to drink his coffee
while telling his story. He said that he kept a
country store in a village in Arkansas, where the
young men used to come in the evenings and tell
stories together. He felt that he was leading a
rather narrow life and needed intelligence, but did
not know where to obtain it. There were books
enough in the world, but how could he choose the
right ones? A newspaper fell under his notice
containing some mention of the C. L. S. C.; he
sent his fee to the office, obtained the books for the
year, and began to read in the intervals of time between
customers in his store. For retirement he
fixed up a desk and shelf of books in the rear of
the shop. Some of his evening callers said, "What
have you got back there?" and he showed his
books, telling them of the C. L. S. C. A number<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
of them at once decided to join, and soon he found
himself the conductor of a Chautauqua Circle with
twenty members. They fixed up a meeting place
in a store-room in a garret under the eaves, talked
over the topics, and read papers. When the text-book
on electricity was before them, they made
experiments with home-made batteries and ran
wires all around the room. The man said, "Those
fellows look to me to answer all sorts of questions,
and I find that I am getting beyond my depth.
I have come to Chautauqua to fill up and I'm
doing it. But the difficulty is that too many
things come at the same time; here's a lecture
on American authors and one on biology, and
one on history, all at once, and I never know
which to attend. But Chautauqua is a great
place, isn't it?"</p>

<p>A servant in a family, while waiting at the table,
heard the lady and her daughters talking of the
Circle which was being formed. The girl asked
her mistress if she would be permitted to join.
With some hesitation, the lady said, "Why, yes, if
you really wish to read the books, you can be a
member." This serving-maid soon showed herself
as the brightest scholar in the group, far superior
in her thirst for knowledge to her young mistresses.
She was encouraged and aided to seek a higher<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
education, entered a Normal School, and became
a successful teacher.</p>

<p>One letter received at the office contained, in
brief, the following: "I am a working-man with six
children and I work hard to keep them in school.
Since I found out about your Circle, I have begun
to read, getting up early in the morning to do it.
I am trying hard to keep up, so that my boys will
see what father does&mdash;just as an example to them."</p>

<p>A letter from a night watchman said, "I read
as I come on my rounds to the lights, and think it
over between times."</p>

<p>A steamboat captain on one of the western
rivers wrote that he enjoyed reading the books
and found the recollection of their contents a great
benefit, "for when I stand on the deck at night I
have something good to think about; and you know
that when one has not taken care of his thoughts
they will run away with him and he will think
about things he ought not."</p>

<p>I was well acquainted with a gentleman and his
wife, both of unspotted character, but unfortunately
living apart from some incompatibility.
He was accustomed to call upon her every fortnight,
in a formal manner, professedly to meet
their children, and on one of his visits he mentioned
that he was beginning the C. L. S. C. readings. She<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
was desirous of knowing what those letters meant;
he explained and gave her a circular of information.
She, too, joined the Circle, and next time at his call
they spent an evening pleasantly discussing the
subjects of reading that both were pursuing. From
a fortnightly they dropped into a weekly interview,
and after a time spent nearly all their evenings
together. One day I met them together, and being
aware of their former relations, I perhaps showed
surprise. The husband took me aside and said
that they were now living together very happily,
thanks to the C. L. S. C. They had forgotten
their differences in a common object of
interest.</p>

<p>In the early years of the C. L. S. C. one book
of the course was on the subject of practical
Christianity. At one time, the religious book was
<i>The Philosophy of the Plan of Salvation</i>, by
Dr. Walker, a work widely read two generations
ago and regarded as a standard. We received at
the office a letter from a high-school teacher who
said that he was an agnostic and did not wish to
read such a book&mdash;could he not read some scientific
work by Tyndall or Huxley in place of it? Miss
Kimball referred his letter to me, and I took it to
Dr. Vincent. He considered the question, and
then wrote in substance this answer:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>If you were a Unitarian, you could read a volume
by James Martineau; if you were a Roman Catholic,
you could read one of many good Catholic religious
books; if you were a Jew you might take some book
upon your own religion. But you call yourself an
agnostic, that is, one who does not know God and has
no religion, and therefore, to meet the requirements of
your course it will be necessary for you to read some
candid, sane work on the Christian religion; and such
is Walker's "Plan of Salvation."</p></div>

<p>The letter closed with a friendly request that
he would read the book without a strong prejudice
against it, and some hearty sympathetic
sentences which Dr. Vincent knew how to write.
For a year we heard nothing of the man; we concluded
that he had been offended at the requirement
and had left the Circle. We were surprised
when at last another letter came from him stating
that he had read the book, at first unwillingly, but
later with deep interest; also that association with
believers in the Circle had shown them, not as he
had supposed, narrow and bigoted, but broad in
their views. He had seen in them a mystic something
which he desired; he had sought and found
it. "To-day," he wrote, "I have united with the
Presbyterian Church, and this evening I led the
Christian Endeavor meeting."</p>

<p>Dr. Hale told of a man who had been formerly a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
pupil and youth in his church, who was suffering
from nervous prostration, and lay down in a shack
in an out-of-the-way place in Florida, almost ready
to die. His eyes were drawn to the orange-colored
cover of a magazine which he had never seen before,
<i>The Chautauquan</i>. He opened it at random
and began to read. "Are you a child of God?
Are you a partaker of the divine nature? If you
are, work with God! Don't give up working with
God!" It seemed to him like a voice from heaven.
On that moment he said to himself, "I will not
die, but live!" He began to read the magazine
and followed it by reading the books to which the
magazine made reference. They opened before
him a new field of thought and made of him a new
man. He told this story to Dr. Hale in his own
church and said: "I am here because of that
orange-covered <i>Chautauquan</i> which I found lying
under the bench in that old cabin."</p>

<p>It is possible, nay, it is certain, that the Chautauqua
Circle, by being not a church society, but a
secular organization permeated by the Christian
spirit, has exercised an influence all the stronger to
promote an intelligent, broad-minded Christianity.</p>

<p>Everyone active in Chautauqua work through
a series of years could narrate many stories like
the above, and doubtless some more remarkable;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
but I have given only a few out of many that could
be recalled out of an experience with the C. L. S. C.
through more than forty years. As I have looked
upon the representatives of the graduating class
in the Hall of Philosophy, I have often wished
that I might know some of the life-stories of those
who, often through difficulties unknown, have
carried the course through to completion.</p>

<p>An eminent minister wrote to me recently as
follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>At a place where I became pastor I found two sisters
who were living in dark seclusion, brooding in melancholia
as the effect of a great sorrow. They attended
church, but took no part in our work, and none at all
in society. I did my best to comfort those young
women and bring them out of their monasticism. But
it was all in vain. Their broken spirits revolted
from a religion of happiness. A few years after my
pastorate was ended there, and I was preaching elsewhere,
I visited the town and was surprised to find
both those women among the most active women in
the church, happy, gifted, and universally esteemed.
What had wrought the change? They chanced to
hear of the Chautauqua Reading Course and sent for
the books and magazines. They pursued the course,
graduated, and visited Chautauqua. It awakened their
entire being and brought them into a new world. They
were literally born anew. I have witnessed wonderful
changes in people, but never any that was more thorough,
real, and permanent than in those young women.</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>Let us name also some of the leading events of
the Assembly of 1884. As the organ of the C. Y.
F. R. U. Dr. Flood established <i>The Youth's C. L.
S. C. Paper</i> for boys and girls. It was an illustrated
magazine, but only twelve numbers were
published, as the field for periodical literature
for young people was already well covered.
"The Chautauqua Foreign Tour," a series of
illustrated lectures on the British Isles, was conducted
this year by Rev. Jesse Bowman Young,
Professor H. H. Ragan, and Mr. George Makepeace
Towle. Music was abundant and varied
this season, the choir being led by Professors
Sherwin and Case in turn; concerts by a remarkable
quartet, the Meigs Sisters; the delightful
singers of southern plantation and revival songs,
the Tennesseans; the Yale College Glee Club;
Miss Belle McClintock, Mrs. J. C. Hull, Mr. E. O.
Excell, and Miss Tuthill, soloists. Dr. Charles
J. Little gave a course of lectures on English literature;
Dr. Henson, Miss Susan Hayes Ward, Dr.
J. W. Butler of Mexico, and Dr. S. S. Smith of
Minnesota were among the lecturers. We heard
Ram Chandra Bose and Dennis Osborne of India,
and Sau Aubrah of Burmah, a most interesting
speaker on the customs of his country and his
impressions of ours. Principal Fairbairn of Oxford<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
made the history of philosophy interesting,
and the Rev. A. J. Palmer of New York won instant
fame by his great war lecture, "Company D,
the Die-no-more's," given on Grand Army Day to
a great concourse of old soldiers.</p>

<p>On Saturday, August 23d, a reception was given
to the Governor of Pennsylvania, Hon. Robert E.
Pattison. Friday, August 15th, was observed as
the decennial anniversary of the Woman's Christian
Temperance Union. I find on the program
of that year a series of colloquies named "The
Socratic Academy," conducted by Dr. H. H.
Moore. I know not what subjects they discussed,
nor how they discussed them, but I remember
Dr. Moore as one able to shed light on any subject
that he chose to present. As I read the program
of any one of those years at Chautauqua, I
realize how utterly inadequate must be any sketch
like the above to bring it before a reader.</p>

<p>By this time three classes of the C. L. S. C.
had been graduated, '82, '83, and '84. Four more
classes were pursuing the course, so that C. L.
S. C. members present at Chautauqua might now
be counted by the thousand. There was a strong
class-spirit. Each class had its name, its motto,
its badge, and its banner, and ribbon badges were
fluttering everywhere. Every day came announcements<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
from the platform of class-meetings, and it
was sometimes difficult to provide for them all.
During the season of 1884 two classes united their
interests, raised money, and purchased a small
octagonal building near the Hall of Philosophy.
These were the classes of '83 and '85. The movement
for class headquarters was growing; all the
other classes began the raising of building funds,
and those who looked into the future saw all
around St. Paul's Grove the prospect of small
buildings rising. How would the grounds appear
when forty classes should have little headquarters&mdash;a
C. L. S. C. village? The plan began to be
mooted of a Union Class Building, to be realized
later.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<h3>THE CHAPLAIN'S LEG AND OTHER TRUE TALES<br />
(1885-1888)</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> twelfth year of the Assembly, 1885, opened
with a preliminary week, beginning July 7th, for
the Teachers' Retreat and the School of Languages,
and closed with "After-week," making
the entire session fifty-three days long, ending on
August 28th. But the official "opening" did not
take place until the traditional date, Tuesday,
August 7th. For years, indeed from the beginning,
Dr. Vincent had set his heart on having a
chime of bells at Chautauqua. The practically
minded trustees urged for some needed improvement,
and buildings for the growing schools, but
the poetic conception carried the day, and in 1885
the Meneely chime of ten bells was heard at the
opening in July. Some common souls in cottages
around complained of their frequency, awaking
folks early in the morning and breaking their naps
in the afternoon, but to most their mellow music
was a welcome sound.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p>It has always been the rule that quiet must
reign on the grounds after the night bells at 10:00
P.M., and watchmen have been wont to knock at
doors where the rule was honored in the breach
instead of the observance. A parlor full of young
people enjoying themselves does not always come
to silence in a minute. I remember one house
near the Point where dwelt an elderly lady with
abundant gray hair but a young heart, and also
with an attractive daughter. That home was
exceedingly popular among the younger set, and
their meetings&mdash;doubtless held for the discussion
of serious subjects, for the voices were sometimes
loud&mdash;were often prolonged beyond the time of
the bells. One night an unusually imperative rap
of the watchman's stick on the front door startled
the group. The door was opened a little and the
matron put forth her head with the words loudly
spoken, "Shoot, if you must, this old gray head!"
whereupon the watchman departed without a
word.</p>

<p>In the revolution of the Chautauqua Circle, 1885
was known as the Roman year, having as its major
subject Latin history and literature. The studies
of the "Foreign Tour" in the Assembly program
embraced lectures, with illustrations on Italian
cities and scenery. Dr. Vincent's fertile mind<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
conceived a plan to aid the students of the course,
and incidentally to advertise it, by a series of
object-lessons. He divided Pratt Avenue, the
path leading up to the college on the hill, into sections
corresponding by their relative lengths to the
periods of Roman history, and erected at the
proper points along the road, posts to commemorate
the leading events, with dates and names of
the great men of the several periods. These milestones
were black, with inscriptions in white. As
people passed by they would be reminded of the
leading facts in the story of the Eternal City.
Often might be seen members of the C. L. S. C.,
notebook in hand, storing their minds with the
dates and events in the annals of Rome. The
coal-black pillars had a somewhat sepulchral look
and suggested a graveyard. One lady who was a
stranger at Chautauqua, and evidently not a
member of the C. L. S. C., asked Dr. R. S. Holmes,
one of the leading workers, "Can you tell me why
all these tombstones have been set up here. Surely
all the men named on them cannot be buried along
this street!" The question was also asked if it
was proposed each year to set up a row of trophies
on other streets for the American year, the English
year, the Greek year, and by degrees to turn
all Chautauqua into a memorial grove for great<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
men and great deeds of all the ages; but at the close
of the season the monuments were gathered up
and carried away, leaving no successors.</p>

<p>The lecture platform of 1885 was as strong as
ever. Dr. Charles F. Deems of New York delivered
the baccalaureate sermon on Sunday,
August 16th, an unique discourse on the short text,
"One New Man" (Eph. 2:15), and the Recognition
Address on the following Wednesday was by
Dr. E. E. Hale of Boston. A special series of
"Yale University Historical Lectures" was given
by Professor Arthur M. Wheeler. Bishop Cyrus
D. Foss of the Methodist Episcopal Church
preached on Sunday, August 23d. Dr. John P.
Newman delivered a lecture on August 25th in
memory of President U. S. Grant, of whom he had
been a friend and pastor. This year a young man
made his first appearance upon the Chautauqua
platform, not yet as a lecturer, but introducing
speakers in felicitous sentences and presiding with
the ease of an experienced chairman. This was
Mr. George Edgar Vincent, just graduated from
Yale University, from whom Chautauqua and the
world in general was to hear before many years.</p>

<p>In 1885, the institution received a new charter
from the Legislature of New York, giving it the
name "Chautauqua University" and the power<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
to confer degrees. By vote of the Board, the title
"Chancellor of the Chautauqua University" was
given to Dr. Vincent. It was hoped to establish a
college for study by correspondence, with reviews
of the subjects taught in the summer meeting.
But the expense of a professional staff was great
and the number of students was not large enough
to support it without an endowment. The Chautauqua
University might have won a place in the
world of education, if friends had been found to
bestow upon it a liberal endowment, but among
the varied gifts of Dr. Vincent was not that peculiar
talent for raising money. The University
did not prosper, and in 1898 the Trustees voluntarily
surrendered to the Regents of the
University of the State of New York the examination
of candidates and the conferring of degrees.
Again the title was changed and the University
became "The Chautauqua System of Education."</p>

<p>The year 1886 ushered in some improvements.
In place of the old wharf stood a new pier building,
three stories high, with stores on the upper balcony,
for the steamboat still brought most of the
Chautauqua crowds and at their arrival a throng
was always present to greet them. Above the
building rose a tower, from which sounded forth
over the lake and through the Grove the melody<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
of the Chautauqua chimes. On the hill was the
new Jewett House, given by Mrs. A. H. Jewett as
a home for self-supporting young women, teachers
and others, while at Chautauqua.</p>

<p>The program of that year shows that a faculty
of sixteen conducted the work in the Chautauqua
Teachers' Retreat, and fifteen others gave courses
in the School of Languages. Lessons in Harmony,
Organ and Piano, Drawing and Painting were also
added. The Chautauqua School of Physical Education
was established under the direction of Dr.
W. G. Anderson. All these were signs that the
system of summer schools at Chautauqua was increasing
its range of study, as well as growing in
the number of its students.</p>

<p>One of the lecturers at this season was Professor
Caleb T. Winchester of Wesleyan University. It
was a privilege to listen to his scholarly yet delightful
account of a ramble in the English lake
country, with estimates of the literary lights who
made that region famous. Dr. Wm. H. Milburn,
the blind chaplain of the United States Senate,
Dr. Russell H. Conwell, with his lecture of "Acres
of Diamonds," Dr. Edward E. Hale and Mrs.
Mary A. Livermore also gave lectures. Dr.
Hale read his story, <i>In His Name;</i> and at the
close of his reading came a general rush for his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
autograph. I happened to be in charge of the
platform, and tried to excuse the speaker from
adding to his burdens, but he declared his willingness
to meet the demands of the people and wrote
in every album offered. In the crowd was a little
girl, shabbily dressed, who had no album, but
brought a scrap of brown paper which she had
picked up. Dr. Hale looked at the torn fragment,
then took the copy of his story from which he had
been reading, wrote on its fly-leaf his name, and
handed it to the little girl.</p>

</div>

<p>Two lecturers from the South attracted attention.
One was the Rev. J. W. Lee, an able,
broad-minded man; the other was the unique
evangelist, Rev. Sam P. Jones, whose utterances
were sometimes eloquent, sometimes jocose, sometimes
shocking, but always interesting. Dr. Willis
J. Beecher of the Auburn Theological Seminary,
Dr. John Hall of New York, and President William
F. Warren of Boston University were also among
the speakers.</p>

<p>Readings were given by Will M. Carleton,
George W. Cable, and General Lew Wallace, from
their own writings. An immense crowd packed the
Amphitheater to hear General Wallace read from
his <i>Ben Hur</i> the story of the Chariot Race. But
candor compels us to say that it was not very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
thrillingly rendered. One who listened said, "He
never got his horses off the walk." Other readers
were George Riddle of Boston and Professor R. L.
Cumnock of Northwestern University. This summer
Mrs. Frank Beard collected and conducted
an Oriental Exhibition.</p>

<p>Almost every year Frank Beard was at Chautauqua,
teaching a class in art, making pictures in
the children's class, giving one or two crayon
lectures, and occasionally on Sunday evenings an
illustrated Bible reading. As already intimated,
that was the age when there was a craze for autographs,
and everybody carried around an autograph
album, seeking signatures from the celebrities.
After a popular lecture a crowd hastened
to the platform and a hundred hands, each holding
an album, would be stretched out toward the
speaker, demanding his autograph. Of course
every child, and nearly every grown-up, must have
Frank Beard's autograph, and with it a picture
drawn by his hand. Frank said once in a religious
meeting that his idea of heaven was a place where
there were no autograph albums.</p>

<p>Every year at Chautauqua is held a National
Army Day, when the Civil War veterans from
near and far assemble, wear their G. A. R. uniforms
and badges, and listen to an address in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
Amphitheater. One year, I think it was 1886,
but I am not sure, the orator was late in coming,
and Mr. Beard, himself a veteran of the war, was
called upon to fill the vacancy. He told the story
of "The Chaplain's Leg," of which some incredulous
people have doubted the authenticity. As I
remember it was somewhat as follows. He would
come forward, slapping his right leg, and saying:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>That is a good leg, but it isn't mine. It belonged
once to the chaplain of our regiment; I was in a
battle and happened to have a tree between myself and
the whole rebel army. There was a change in the
front, and I started to make a detour to another tree.
Just in the middle of my march I ran against the
chaplain, who was also making a detour, and at that
moment came along a rebel shell, which took off one
of his legs and also one of mine. We lay on the ground
only a minute or two, and then an ambulance took us
and the two legs on board. They carried us to the
field hospital, and put on our legs, which grew just as
they should, so that after a few weeks I was dismissed
as cured. Well, I had been a long time, for me, without
liquid refreshment, and I knew that out in the
woods near the camp was an extemporized bar, in the
shape of a board laid on two stumps of trees. I found
it hard to walk in that direction, and had to pull my
right leg along; but I thought that it needed only a
little practice to be as good as ever. I got to the bar
and ordered a glass of something; it might have been
ginger-pop or it might have been something else. Just
after it was poured out and before I could take hold of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
it, that right leg of mine lifted itself up and kicked
over the whole contraption&mdash;glass, and jug, and bar,
and then in spite of all I could do, stumped me back to
camp! And on the way I passed the chaplain who
was being dragged out <i>to</i> the bar, while I was being
pulled away from it. Then I knew what had happened
in the hospital; they had put each leg on the
wrong man, and I must carry around the chaplain's
leg as long as I lived. The leg took me to church; at
first it was pretty tough, but I got used to it. That
leg brought me to Chautauqua, and here I am to-day,
brought by the chaplain's leg. Some time ago I gave
by request a lecture with pictures in the Sing Sing
prison, and there among the convicts sat my old friend
the chaplain, wearing a striped suit. What brought
him there I can't imagine, unless&mdash;well, I don't know
what it was.</p></div>

<p>The Assembly of 1887 was fifty-eight days in
length, from July 2d to August 28th. The schools
were still growing in the number of students and enlarging
their courses. Some of the new departments
were the Arabic and Assyrian languages,
mathematics, chemistry, oratory and expression,
stenography, mineralogy, and geology. To house
these classes and the army of students, buildings
were urgently needed, and this year a College
Building arose overlooking the lake. It stood
until two years ago, when on account of its dilapidation
as well as its incongruity with the modern
plans of the schools, it was taken down.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span></p>

<p>During the season of 1887, the Fourth of July
Address was given by Hon. Roswell G. Horr,
member of Congress from Michigan. Dr. Fairbairn
from Oxford was with us again, also the
Rev. Mark Guy Pearse of England, Dr. Charles J.
Little, Dr. John A. Broadus of Louisville, one of
those scholars who know how to present great truths
in a simple manner, Chaplain McCabe, Dr. Charles
R. Henderson, on social questions of the time, and
Mrs. Mary A. Livermore. Rev. Sam P. Jones
was also on the platform for the second season.
He gave his powerful sermon on "Conscience"
with not a sentence to provoke a smile, but a
strong call to righteousness. Another address,
however, contained an application which called
forth a smile all over the audience. It was known
that Dr. Vincent was being strongly talked of as a
candidate for Bishop in the Methodist Episcopal
Church, and in the following May, 1888, he was
elected to that office. Dr. Vincent was presiding
at Mr. Jones' lecture. In the address Jones managed
to bring in an allusion to bishops. Then
turning halfway round toward the chairman, he
said, "Doctor Vincent, I shouldn't wonder if they
made you and me bishops before long. You see
the thing's coming down."</p>

<p>The class graduating this year in the C. L. S. C.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
was the largest in the history of the Circle. It included
in its membership the Rev. G. R. Alden and
his wife, and was named in her honor, the Pansy
class. At this time the enrolled members of the C.
L. S. C. were more than eighty thousand in number.</p>

<p>The Assembly of 1888 opened on July 3d and
closed on August 29th, fifty-eight days in length.
The summer school was now announced as the
College of Liberal Arts. I notice in the list of
subjects taught: Old French, Scandinavian languages
and literature, Sanskrit, Zend and Gothic,
Hebrew and Semitic languages, and philology. It
is not to be supposed that all of these classes were
overcrowded with students, but those in physical
culture and arts and crafts were very popular.
The annual exhibition of the gymnastic classes has
been for years one of the most thronged events on
the program, and in anticipation the Amphitheater
is filled long in advance of the hour for
beginning the exercises.</p>

<p>Among the lecturers of this season were Mrs.
Alden, "Pansy," who read a new story, <i>The Hall
in the Grove;</i> Dr. William R. Harper, Dr. Frank
W. Gunsaulus, Dr. Joseph Cook, Dr. Talmage,
Dr. Hale, General Russell A. Alger, and George
W. Bain. Dr. Phillips Brooks, giant in body and
in soul, preached one of his sermons, sweeping<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
in swift utterances like a tidal wave. One hardly
dared draw a breath for fear of losing his mighty
periods. Bishop William Taylor of Africa, was
also present, and thrilled his hearers, yet in a calm,
quiet manner, absolutely free from any oratorical
display. There was a charm in his address and
the most critical hearers felt it, yet could not
analyze it. I met, not at Chautauqua but elsewhere,
a lawyer who admitted that he rarely attended
church because he could not endure the
dull sermons; but after listening to Bishop Taylor,
said that if he could hear that man he would go to
church twice, even three times, on a Sunday. And
yet in all his discourse there was not a rhetorical
sentence nor a rounded period.</p>

<p>Mr. Leon H. Vincent was again at Chautauqua,
with his literary lectures. Either during this
season or the one when he came next&mdash;for he was
generally present every alternate year&mdash;it became
necessary to move Leon Vincent's lectures from
the Hall of Philosophy to the Amphitheater, on
account of the number who were eager to hear
them. Among those who gave readings were Mr.
Charles F. Underhill of New York, Mr. George
Riddle, and Professor R. L. Cumnock.</p>

<p>The Methodists, both of the North and the
South, have always formed a large element in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
Chautauqua constituency, partly because of their
number throughout the continent, but also because
both the Founders of the Assembly were members
of that church. This year, 1888, the Methodist
House was opened, in the center of the ground,
and at once became the social rallying place of the
denomination. Its chapel, connected with the
House, was built afterward by the all-year residents
at Chautauqua as the home of the community
church, which is open to all and attended
by all, the only church having a resident pastor
and holding services through the year, nominally
under the Methodist system, but practically
undenominational.</p>

<p>In May, 1888, Dr. John H. Vincent, after twenty
years in charge of the Sunday School work as
Secretary and Editor, was elected and consecrated
a Bishop in the Methodist Episcopal
Church. For some years his episcopal residence
was at Buffalo, within easy distance of Chautauqua,
but his new duties required him to travel
even more widely than before, and he needed an
assistant to care for the work of the Assembly.
Mr. George E. Vincent, able son of distinguished
father, was this year appointed Vice-Principal of
Instruction, and assumed a closer supervision of
the program of Chautauqua.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>

<p>In this year, also, Dr. William Rainey Harper
was made Principal of the College of Liberal Arts,
all the departments of the Summer School being
under his direction. Another name appears on
the record of 1888, the name of Alonzo A. Stagg,
haloed in the estimate of young Chautauqua with
a glory even surpassing that of the two Founders.
For Stagg, just graduated from Yale, could curve
a baseball more marvelously than any other man
in America. He was one of the instructors in the
gymnasium, and organized a team that played
with most of the baseball clubs for miles around
Chautauqua, almost invariably winning the game.
It was said that the athletic field rivaled the
Amphitheater in its crowds when Stagg played.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<h3>A NEW LEAF IN LUKE'S GOSPEL<br />
(1889-1892)</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Assembly of 1889 opened on July 3d and
continued fifty-five days, to August 26th. Several
new buildings had arisen since the last session. One
was the Anne M. Kellogg Memorial Hall, built by
Mr. James H. Kellogg of Rochester, New York, in
honor of his mother. In it were rooms for kindergarten,
clay modeling, china painting, and a
meeting place for the Chautauqua W. C. T. U.
It stood originally on the site of the present Colonnade
Building, the business block, and was moved
to its present location to make room for that building.
Mr. Kellogg was an active worker in the
Sunday School movement and from the beginning
a regular visitor at Chautauqua. Another building
of this year was the one formerly known as the
Administration Office, on Clark Avenue in front
of the book-store and the old Museum, now the
Information Bureau and the School of Expression.
When the offices of the Institution were removed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
to the Colonnade, the old Administration Building
was given up to business, and it is now known as a
lunch-room. The School of Physical Culture,
under Dr. W. G. Anderson, had grown to such an
extent that a new gymnasium had become a necessity,
and one had been erected on the lake-front.
In the newer part of the grounds many private
cottages arose, of more tasteful architecture than
the older houses.</p>

<p>A notable event of this season was the visit of
former President Rutherford B. Hayes of Ohio.
Among the lecturers of 1889 we find the name of
Mr. Donald G. Mitchell, whose <i>Reveries of a
Bachelor</i> and <i>Dream-Life</i>, published under the
pseudonym of Ik Marvel, are recognized classics
in American literature. Other eminent men on
the platform were Professor Hjalmar H. Boyesen
of Columbia University, Professor J. P. Mahaffy
of Dublin University, Dr. Lyman Abbott, Dr.
Frank W. Gunsaulus, Dr. Washington Gladden,
Dr. John Henry Barrows, Professor Frederick
Starr, who could make anthropology interesting
to those who had never studied it, Professor Herbert
B. Adams, and Corporal Tanner, the U. S.
Commissioner of Pensions, a veteran who walked
on two cork legs, but was able to stand up and give
a heart-warming address to the old soldiers. Dr.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
W. R. Harper, who was teaching in the School
of Theology, gave a course of lectures on the
Hebrew prophets. Bishop Cyrus D. Foss, one of
the great preachers of the Methodist Episcopal
Church, delivered a sermon on one of the Sundays.
The South sent us an able lecturer in Richard
Malcolm Johnson. The orator on Recognition
Day, of the Class of '89, was Dr. David Swing of
Chicago, who spoke on "The Beautiful and the
Useful." Dr. Russell H. Conwell gave some
lectures, abundant in their illustrative stories.</p>

<p>I think that this was the year, but am not certain,
when Dr. Conwell preached one Sunday in the
Amphitheater a sermon of remarkable originality,
listened to with the closest attention by his hearers,
because he kept them guessing as to his subject
until he was more than half-way through. He
said in opening, "I will give my text at the end of
the sermon, if I don't forget it; but I will tell you
my subject. I am going to speak of a man whom
our Lord called the Model Church Member."
We all began wondering who that man was, but
nobody could recall him. He said that this model
man lived among the mountains, and spoke of the
influence of surroundings upon character; then
that where he lived there were two churches, one
large, the other small, one aristocratic and popular,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
the other of the lower classes, despised; and that
this man was a member of the church looked down
upon; but these facts gave us no hint as to the
model man's identity. He puzzled us once more
by saying that this was a business man who had
good credit, and we were still in the fog;&mdash;when
did Jesus ever talk about credit? Then he told
in graphic manner, making it seem as if it had
happened the day before, the story of the Good
Samaritan, and the problem was solved. But he
astonished us again by saying, "There was one
part of this story which for some reason St. Luke
left out of his gospel, and I am going to tell it
now";&mdash;and of course everybody was eager to
hear a brand-new Bible story not found in the
Scriptures. He told that this man who had been
robbed and beaten on the Jericho road, after
his recovery at the inn, went home to Jerusalem,
met his family, and then took his two boys up to
the Temple to return thanks for his restoration.
The service in all its splendor was described. One
boy said, "Father, see that priest waving a censer!
What a good man he must be!" But the man
said, "My boy, don't look at that hypocrite!
That is the very priest who left me to die beside the
road!" After a few minutes, the younger boy
said, "See that Levite blowing a trumpet! He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
looks like a good man, doesn't he?" And the
father said, "My boys, that is the very Levite that
passed me by when I was lying wounded! Let us
go away from this place." And then one of the
boys said, "Let us find the church of the Good
Samaritan, and worship there." And Dr. Conwell
added, "My text is, 'Go thou and do likewise!'"
No one who heard that sermon, so full
of surprises, could ever forget it.</p>

<p>The elocutionary readers who entertained us
during that season were Professor Cumnock,
A. P. Burbank, George Riddle, George W. Cable,
reading his own stories, and Mr. Leland Powers
of Boston, with his rendering of <i>David Copperfield</i>,
several other stories, and a play or two.
Without the aid of costume or "making up," it
was wonderful how he could change facial expression,
and voice, and manner instantaneously with
his successive characters. We saw Mr. Micawber
transformed in an instant into Uriah Heep. From
1889, Mr. Powers was a frequent visitor, and his
rendering of novels and plays enraptured the
throngs in the Amphitheater. For many seasons
he was wont to appear on alternate years. On
Old First Night, when the call was made for those
present on the successive years, while the regulars
stood up and remained standing as each year was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
named, it was interesting to watch the down-sittings
and uprisings of Leland Powers. But we
shall hear his voice no more, for even while we
are writing the news of his death comes to us.</p>

<p>In this year, 1889, the musical classes were organized
as the Chautauqua School of Music, with
instructors in all departments. Inasmuch as all
people do not enjoy the sound of a piano, practicing
all day scales and exercises, a place was found
in the rear of the grounds for a village of small
cottages, some might call them "huts," each
housing a piano for lessons and practice. I am
told that forty-eight pianos may be heard there
all sending out music at once, and each a different
tune.</p>

<p>The year 1889 brought another man to Chautauqua
who was well-beloved and will be long
remembered, the pianist and teacher, William H. Sherwood,
who showed himself a true Chautauquan
by his willing, helpful spirit, no less than by his
power on the piano. When death stilled those
wondrous fingers, Mr. Sherwood's memory was
honored by the Sherwood Memorial Studios, dedicated
in 1912.</p>

<p>When we realize that Chautauqua is a city of
frame-buildings, packed closely together on narrow
streets, in the early years having exceedingly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
inadequate protection against fires, we almost
wonder that it has never been overswept by a
conflagration. From time to time there have been
fires, most of them a benefit in clearing away old
shacks of the camp-meeting strata; and one took
place on a night during the season of 1889. It
swept away a row of small houses along the southwestern
border of Miller Park, toward the Land
of Palestine. Their site was kept unoccupied,
leaving a clear view of the lake, except on one
corner where a handsome building was erected,
the Arcade. While the main entrance to the
grounds was at the Pier, this was a prosperous
place of business, but after the back door became
the front door, through the coming of the Chautauqua
Traction Company, giving railroad connection
with the outside world, the business center of
Chautauqua shifted to streets up the hill.</p>

<p>The year 1890 came, bringing the seventeenth
session of the Assembly. This was the year when
the Presbyterian House was opened, and also the
C. L. S. C. building, erected by Flood and Vincent,
for Mr. George E. Vincent was now a partner with
Dr. Flood in publishing <i>The Chautauquan Magazine</i>
and the books of the C. L. S. C. Subsequently
the business of publication was assumed by the
Institution, and the building has been for many<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
years the book-store, with rooms on the floor above
for classes in the School of Expression.</p>

<p>An announcement in the program of the College
of Liberal Arts was that a School of Journalism
would be conducted by Hamilton Wright
Mabie, essayist, and one of the editors of <i>The Outlook</i>.
Leon H. Vincent gave another course of
literary lectures. Dr. Henry L. Wayland of
Philadelphia was one of the speakers. John
Habberton, author of the "best seller" some years
before, <i>Helen's Babies</i>, lectured, read, joined the
C. L. S. C. Class of 1894, and was made its President.
Dr. Francis E. Clark, father of the Christian
Endeavor Society, came and was greeted by
a host of young Endeavorers. Dr. Alexander
McKenzie of Cambridge, Mass., preached a great
sermon. Mr. Robert J. Burdette, at that time an
editor, but afterwards a famous Baptist preacher,
gave one of his wisely-witty lectures. The Hon.
John Jay, worthy son of one of New York's most
distinguished families, gave an address. Dr.
Fairbairn of Oxford was again among us, with his
deep lectures, yet clear as the waters of Lake
Tahoe. The orator on Recognition Day was
Mrs. Alice Freeman Palmer, whose term as President
made Wellesley great. Mr. Thomas Nelson
Page gave readings from his own stories of southern<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
life before the Civil War. A young man
appeared on the platform for the first time, but
not the last, who was destined to stand forth in a
few years as one of the foremost of Americans.
This was Theodore Roosevelt, whose lectures at
Chautauqua were later expanded into the volumes
on <i>The Winning of the West</i>. Colonel Thomas
Wentworth Higginson, soldier and historian, also
gave lectures.</p>

<p>At the opening of the season in 1891, the members
of the Chautauqua Circle counted more than
a hundred thousand. Nine classes had been
graduated, another large class was to receive its
diplomas during that summer, and there were
three undergraduate classes each of nearly twenty
thousand members, with another class as large in
prospect. Only a small section of each class could
be present at Chautauqua, the vast majority of
its members being far away, some in distant lands.
But among those who came to the Assembly, the
social spirit was strong. They loved to meet each
other, held social reunions and business meetings
constantly. Each of the four oldest classes, from
'82 to '85, had its own building as headquarters,
but all the later classes were homeless and in need
of homes. It was a great boon to these classes
when at last, in 1891, the C. L. S. C. Alumni Hall<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
was completed and opened. Its eight class-rooms
were distributed by lot and furnished by the gifts
of the members. As new classes were organized
year after year, they were welcomed by the
classes already occupying the rooms. It was not
many years before each room became the home of
two classes, then after eight years more of three
classes, meeting on different days, but united in
the general reception on the evening before the
Recognition Day. Beside the eight class-rooms
on the second floor of the Alumni Building there
is a large hall which is used before the Recognition
Day by the graduating class, and during the rest
of the season by the new entering class. In 1916,
after the death of Miss Kate F. Kimball, Secretary
of the C. L. S. C, this hall was named "The Kimball
Room." The Alumni Building with its wide
porches became at Chautauqua a social center for
the members of the Circle and many have been the
friendships formed there. On this season of 1891
the United Presbyterian House was opened.</p>

<p>The section of the Summer Schools formerly
known as The Teachers' Retreat, but now beginning
to be called "The School of Pedagogy," was
this year (1891) under the direction of that master-teacher
and inspiring leader, Colonel Francis W.
Parker of Chicago. He gave several lectures on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
the principles of teaching, but many besides the
teachers listened to them with equal interest and
profit. One of these lectures was entitled, "The
Artisan and the Artist"; the artisan representing
those in every vocation of life who do their work
by rule; the artist, those who pay little attention
to regulations, but teach, or preach, or design
buildings, or paint pictures out of their hearts;
and these are the Pestalozzis, the Michael Angelos,
the Beechers of their several professions. We had
a course of delightful essay-lectures in the Hall of
Philosophy by Miss Agnes Repplier. The Rabbi
of the Temple Emanuel in New York, Dr. Gustave
Gottheil, gave some enlightening lectures upon the
principles of the Jewish faith. At that time a
prominent Roman Catholic priest, the Rev.
Edward McGlynn, was in rebellion against the
hierarchy of his church, and maintaining a vigorous
controversy in behalf of religious freedom.
He had been dismissed from one of the largest
churches in New York, and with voice and pen
was denouncing the Pope, Cardinals, and Bishops.
Father McGlynn came to Chautauqua and delivered
a powerful address in the Amphitheater,
pouring forth a torrent of language, shot as from a
rapid-firing cannon. While at Chautauqua he
was entertained at a dinner in one of the cottages<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
with a number of invited guests. From the moment
of meeting at the table, he began to talk in
his forceful manner, never stopping to take breath.
Dr. Buckley was present and several times opened
his mouth but found no chance to interject a word,
which was an unusual state of affairs for one who
generally led the conversation.</p>

</div>

<p>Another speaker who was heard with interest
was Jacob A. Riis, with his illustrated lecture on
"How the Other Half Lives." Mr. Riis was only
a newspaper reporter, not occupying an editorial
chair, but Theodore Roosevelt spoke of him as
"New York's most useful citizen." The cause of
woman suffrage and reform had a splendid showing
this season, for Frances E. Willard, Anna Howard
Shaw, Susan B. Anthony, and Mary A. Livermore,
all spoke upon the Amphitheater platform. A
visitor who made many friends was Rev. Dr.
Percival, headmaster of Rugby School. Julia
Ward Howe gave interesting reminiscences of
Longfellow, Emerson, and other literary lights
whom she had known intimately. John Fiske,
one of America's greatest historians, gave a course
of lectures on the discovery and settlement of this
continent. Another historian whom we heard
was John Bach McMaster, whose lectures were
like a series of dissolving views, picture succeeding<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
picture, each showing the great events and
the great men of their period. In this year Dr.
Horatio R. Palmer assumed charge of the musical
department, and for the first time waved his baton
before the great chorus in the Amphitheater
gallery.</p>

<p>As everybody knows, the four hundredth anniversary
of the discovery of America was observed
everywhere in 1892. Chautauqua commemorated
it in lectures on Columbus and his
fellow-voyagers, and by a pageant presenting
scenes from the history. The Chautauqua class
graduating that year was named the Columbia
Class, and as its members, several hundred strong,
marched in the procession, Chancellor Vincent
was astonished to see in the line his wife, wearing
the graduating badge of cardinal ribbon. She
had read the course through four years and kept it
a secret from him, revealed for the first time at
that Recognition service. The address on that
day was delivered by Dr. Frank W. Gunsaulus on
"The Ideal of Culture."</p>

<p>Among the chief speakers in 1892 we find the
names of two Presidents of Cornell University,
Dr. Andrew D. White and Dr. James G. Schurman;
Dr. J. Monro Gibson, a London pastor and
one of the Board of Counsel of the C. L. S. C. was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
with us; also Ballington Booth, Henry Watterson,
the journalist, and President Merrill E. Gates of
Amherst College. At this session also the Girls'
Club was organized and conducted by Miss Mary
H. Mather of Wilmington, Del.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<h3>CLUB LIFE AT CHAUTAUQUA<br />
(1893-1896)</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> the Chautauquans gathered for the
twentieth Assembly on July 1, 1893, they found
some changes had taken place. The old Amphitheater,
which had faithfully served its generation,
but had fallen into decrepitude, no longer lifted its
forest of wooden pillars over the ravine. In its
place stood a new Amphitheater, more roomy and
far more suitable to the needs of the new day.
It was covered by a trussed roof supported by steel
columns standing around the building, so that
from every seat was an unobstructed view of the
platform. The choir-gallery was enlarged to provide
seats for five hundred. The platform was
brought further into the hall, making room for an
orchestra. The seats were more comfortable, and
could now hold without crowding fifty-six hundred
people. A few years later, the old organ gave
place to a greater and better one, the gift of the
Massey family of Toronto, a memorial of their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
father, the late Hart A. Massey, one of the early
Trustees of the Assembly. Under the choir-loft
and on either side of the organ, rooms were arranged
for offices and classes in the Department
of Music.</p>

<p>During the previous season, 1892, a Men's Club
had been organized and had found temporary
quarters. It now possessed a home on the shore
of the Lake, beside Palestine Park. In its rooms
were games of various sorts, cards, however, being
still under the ban at Chautauqua.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Newspapers
and periodicals, shower-baths, and an out-of-door
parlor on the roof, very pleasant except on the
days when the lake flies invaded it. The Men's
Club building had formerly been the power house
of the electrical plant, but one who had known it of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
old would scarcely recognize it as reconstructed,
enlarged, and decorated. To make a place for the
dynamo of the electric system, an encroachment
had been made upon Palestine Park; a cave had
been dug under Mount Lebanon, and the dynamo
installed within its walls. The age of King Hiram
of Tyre, who cut the cedars of Lebanon for Solomon's
Temple, and the age of Edison, inventor of
the electric light, were thus brought into incongruous
juxtaposition. A chimney funnel on the
summit of Mount Lebanon, it must be confessed,
seemed out of place, and the Valley of Coele-Syria,
between Lebanon and Hermon, was entirely
obliterated. Bible students might shake their
heads disapprovingly, but even sacred arch&aelig;ology
must give way to the demands of civilization.</p>

<p>An improvement less obvious to the eye, but
more essential to health, was the installation of a
complete sewer system. As the sewage is not allowed
to taint the water of the lake, it is carried
by pipes to a disposal plant at the lower end of the
ground and chemically purified. The water rendered
as clear as crystal is then permitted to run
into the lake, while the sludge is pressed by machinery
into cakes used as fertilizer. An artesian
well on high ground supplies pure water in abundance,
with taps at convenient places for families.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
Originally the water in use came from wells.
These were carefully tested by scientific experts,
and most of them were condemned, but a few were
found to give forth pure water and are still in use,
though frequently and carefully tested. Near
the Men's Club is a spring of mineral water containing
sulphur and iron. It has the approval of
chemists and physicians, and many drink it for
its healthful effect.</p>

<p>One who looks over the programs of Chautauqua
through successive years will notice the number
of the clubs for various classes and ages. Largest
of all is the Woman's Club, of which Mrs. Emily
Huntington Miller was the first President, succeeded
by Mrs. B. T. Vincent, and carried on under
her leadership for many years. When on account
of failing health Mrs. Vincent felt compelled to
resign her office, her place was taken by Mrs.
Percy V. Pennybacker of Texas, who had been
President of the General Federation of Woman's
Clubs in the United States. This Club includes
more than two thousand members, and its daily
meeting in the Hall of Philosophy brings together
a throng, often too large for the building. In 1918
the Club purchased a cottage fronting on the lake,
near the Hotel Athen&aelig;um, as a headquarters, a place
for social gatherings and rest rooms for women.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span></p>

<p>Besides the Women's Clubs and the Men's
Club, there are at least a dozen other associations
of people having tastes and interests bringing
them together. We will name the most important
of these without regard to their chronological
order.</p>

<p>There is the Athletic Club for men and boys over
sixteen, directing the organized sports and providing
all forms of out-of-door recreation. It has
a club house on the lake with bowling alleys and
boat room, shower baths and lockers, and a reading
room.</p>

<p>The Golf Club has a nine-hole course, situated
on the rising ground of eighty acres opposite the
traction station. The money has been contributed
for a Country Club House, soon to be
built at the entrance. The donors, it is understood,
are Mr. Stephen J. Munger of Dallas, Texas,
one of the Trustees, his wife, and Mrs. Frank B.
Wilcox of St. Petersburg, Florida, in memory of
her husband.</p>

<p>Chautauquans of some years' standing will remember
the old croquet ground, where now stands
the Colonnade, and the group of solemn gray-beards
who used to frequent it and knock the balls
through the big arches all day. No matter what
popular lecturer was speaking in the Amphitheater,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
the passer-by would find that same serious
company. I used to pass them while going to my
home and coming from it several times each day.
On one occasion I stopped and struck up an acquaintance
with a tall old gentleman who always
wore a high hat and a long double-breasted coat.
I learned that he was the President of a Bank
among the mountains of Pennsylvania, and that
he had come to Chautauqua suffering from nervous
prostration, making him utterly unable to do
business and scarcely desiring to live. He passed
the croquet court, sat down, and was invited to
play. He began and found himself, for the first
time in many months, actually interested in doing
something. He began to enjoy his meals and to
sleep at night. All that summer he played
croquet, never listening to a lecture, and at the
end of the season went home almost well. From
that time croquet became more than his recreation,
almost his business. He told me that there were
others like himself who found health and a new
enjoyment of life in the game. When the ground
was needed for the new business block, the courts
were removed to the ravine on the other side of
the grounds, near the gymnasium. About that
time croquet was developed into a more scientific
game, a sort of billiardized croquet, with walls<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
from which a ball would rebound, and arches a
quarter of an inch&mdash;or is it only an eighth of an
inch?&mdash;wider than the ball. To find a name for
the new game they struck off the first and last
letters, so that croquet became Roque, and in due
time the Roque Club arose, with a group of players
who live and breathe and have their being for
this game. People come from far, and I am told,
to attend its tournaments at every season.</p>

<p>There is also a Quoit Club meeting on the
ground near Higgins Hall, beside the road leading
up College Hill.</p>

<p>The Young Woman's Club is for those over fifteen
years of age, while the Girl's Club has its
membership between eight and fifteen, meets in
its own Club House near the roque courts, and is
enthusiastically sought by those no longer little
girls, yet not quite young women.</p>

<p>Wherever one walks around Chautauqua he is
sure to see plenty of boys in blue sweaters bearing
on their bosoms the monogram in big letters
C. B. C, initials of the Chautauqua Boys' Club.
They too have their headquarters near the athletic
field and find something doing there all day long.</p>

<span class="caption">Traction Station</span>

<p>For the little ones, there is the kindergarten at
Kellogg Hall, and out of doors beside it the playground,
where the tots make cities out of sand and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
find other pleasures. And we must not forget
the Children's Paradise, the completely equipped
playground in the ravine at the northwestern part
of the grounds. I remember hearing Jacob A.
Riis, the father of the city playgrounds, say in one
of his lectures: "They tell me that the boys play
ball in the streets of New York and break windows
when the ball goes out of the way. Good! I hope
they will break more windows until the city fixes
up playgrounds for them!" Jacob Riis lived long
enough to see at Chautauqua one of the finest
playgrounds, and to find in it one of the happiest
crowds of children on the continent. One blessing
for tired mothers at Chautauqua is that their
children are in safekeeping. They may be turned
loose, for they can't get outside the fence, and in
the clubs and playgrounds they are under the
wisest and most friendly care.</p>

<p>There are Modern Language Clubs in French
and Spanish, with conversations, recitations, and
songs in these languages. "No English Spoken
Here," might be written over their doors, although
nearly all their members elsewhere do their talking
in the American patois. There was a German
Club, but it was suspended during the war, when
German was an unpopular language and has not
yet been re&euml;stablished.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span></p>

<p>The Music Club holds gatherings, in the Sherwood
Music Studios on College Hill.</p>

<p>There is a Press Club, composed of men and
women who write books and articles for publication.
They hold social receptions for acquaintance
among wielders of the quill; perhaps it
would be more accurate, though less classic, to
say, "pounders of the typewriter." Several times
each season they have an "Author's Night," when
well-known writers, some of them famous, read
their own productions.</p>

<p>There is a Lawyers' Club, a Masonic Club, and
a Grange Club, the latter having its own building
of Greek architecture; also a College Fraternity
Club of the wearers of sundry pins and keys.</p>

<p>The Bird and Tree Club has a large and representative
membership of those interested in identifying
and protecting the fauna, flora, and bird life
of Chautauqua and its vicinity. On the Overlook,
beyond the Athletic Field, they have established
a herbarium for the preservation of the different
forms of trees found on the ground.</p>

<p>We must group together, begging pardon of the
members, many other organizations, such as the
W. C. T. U. All Americans know, some of them
to their cost, what those four letters stand for; the
Y. W. C. A., which has opened a Hospitality<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
House of Welcome and Rest on Pratt Avenue;
the Daughters of the American Revolution, coming
from every part of the land for gatherings at
Chautauqua; the Order of the Eastern Star, whose
secrets none but the initiated know; the College
Men's Club, the College Women's Club, the Ministers'
Club, and there used to be, perhaps is still,
an Octogenarians' Club, whose members must
swear to eighty years of life. The King's Daughters
and King's Sons meet weekly at the Pier
Buildings, and the Chautauqua Education Council,
made up of Superintendents, principals and
teachers, holds two regular sessions each week.
If there are any more clubs, and their titles are
sent to the author of this book, they will appear
in the new edition, after the first hundred thousand
copies are disposed of.</p>

<p>But we are forgetting the title of this chapter
and must name some of those who helped to make
Chautauqua successful during the quadrennium
between '92 and '96. In 1893 Henry Drummond
repeated at Chautauqua his Lowell lectures in
Boston on "The Ascent of Man." There were
still some old-fashioned "kiver to kiver" believers
in the verbal inspiration of the Bible who
were alarmed to find an eminent Christian leader
accept so fully the conclusions of science; but the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
overwhelming sentiment of Chautauqua was of
rejoicing at his harmonizing the most evangelical
religion with the most advanced scholarship. Jane
Addams gave some lectures on modern problems
of family and social life; Edward Eggleston, long
before a leader of the Sunday School Army, by
turns preacher, story-writer (his <i>Hoosier School-Master</i>
marked an epoch in American literature,
say the critics) and historian, was with us once
more after many years of absence. He said in an
introduction, "I am glad to be again among Sunday
School workers, real crazy people, for I believe
that nobody can be a first-class Sunday School
man unless he has a little crack in his head on that
subject." Frank G. Carpenter, who had traveled
in almost every land of earth, told us stories of his
experiences and observations; Kate Douglas Wiggin
read charmingly some of her own stories;
Mr. John Temple Graves spoke in his fine rounded
periods on some topics of the time; Hon. Roswell
G. Horr of Michigan instructed while he entertained
us. Dr. A. J. Palmer, who had thrilled the
old soldiers with his "Company D," now gave
another lecture to them on "Comrades." Besides
these we heard on the platform Dr. Philip
S. Moxom, Professor George H. Palmer of Harvard,
and his wife, Alice Freeman Palmer; President<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
Harper, Dr. Von Hoist; Dr. Conwell, and
Dr. Joseph Cook, returning to the platform with
restored vigor after some years of nervous breakdown.
Miss Willard was with us again, and with
her Lady Henry Somerset of England, the head of
the W. C. T. U. in that land.</p>

<p>In 1894 the Department of Elocution took a
new title, "The School of Expression," and enlarged
its sphere under Professor S. H. Clark of
the University of Chicago, and Mrs. Emily M.
Bishop. The program of the years shows the
school of Political Science to be remarkably strong,
with such teachers as Dr. Herman Von Holst,
Herbert B. Adams of Johns Hopkins, and another
Dr. Adams of Yale. Professor Graham Taylor
of Chicago spoke on social questions, capital and
labor. Hon. Theodore Roosevelt, already rising
to fame, was again on the platform. General
James A. Beaver, ex-governor of Pennsylvania;
Professor Richard G. Moulton; Hon. Carroll D.
Wright, United States Commissioner of Labor;
Mr. Anthony Comstock, and Dr. E. E. Hale,
Chautauqua's strong friend, were some of the
speakers. Dr. Hale, always original in his
methods, said that he had only thirty minutes to
speak on "Poverty and Pauperism." He began by
saying, "I will stand on one side of this desk and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
speak fifteen minutes on poverty." He showed
in seven points that every one of us belonged to
the class named "poverty" and each one should
help the others. Then he walked over to the other
side and gave seven points on "pauperism," for
which there were reasons but no excuses. Poverty
was a blessing; most of the world's greatest benefactors
have been poor men; but pauperism is an
unmitigated evil and should be stamped out of existence.
General O. O. Howard, U. S. A., was again
on the platform in 1894, also President William
H. Crawford of Allegheny College, whose lecture
on "Savonarola" made a deep impression. There
was great interest to see and hear Miss Helen
Keller, the wonderful girl, blind, deaf, and dumb,
who had learned to speak without hearing a voice,
and had been graduated from Radcliffe College
of Harvard University with the highest honor.
Another of the lecturers was Mr. Jahu DeWitt
Miller, whose private talk was as good as his public
lectures, which is high praise. The Recognition
Day address this year was by Dr. E. E. Hale, on
"The Education of a Prince," the prince being the
poorest child living in America. It is worth remembering
that a photograph of the procession
on that day shows at the head of the flower-girl
division&mdash;which now included boys, although the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
girls were still in the majority&mdash;two mites of
children, one Paul Vincent Harper, son of President
Harper, the other Isabel Vincent, the daughter
of Professor George E. Vincent. Those same
children are now Mr. and Mrs. Paul Vincent
Harper of Chicago, still walking together.</p>

<p>In 1895, the season extended through fifty-nine
days, from June 29th to August 26th. Two new
buildings, besides many new cottages, were now
upon the ground. One was the Baptist headquarters
on Clark Street, the other Higgins Hall
on College Hill, built by the gift of Governor Higgins
of New York State. In the Schools during
this season strong emphasis was laid on the Department
of English, with such instructors as
Professor C. T. Winchester of Wesleyan, Professor
A. S. Cook of Yale, Professor Sherman of the University
of Nebraska, and Professor Lewis of the
University of Chicago. The last named gentleman
bore a striking resemblance to the portraits
of Shakespeare; so that as he walked around
(habitually without a hat on his head) everybody
was struck with the likeness. I was told that when
he sat down at Shakespeare's traditional school-desk
in Stratford, a crowd gathered before the
windows and the word was passed around "Shakespeare
has come to life again!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span></p>

<p>Other speakers in 1895 were Professor Richard
G. Moulton, Dr. Josiah Strong, President G.
Stanley Hall, Professor Francis G. Peabody of
Harvard, Major J. B. Pond, Dr. John Henry
Barrows, Dr. Edward Everett Hale, President
Harper, Prof. John Fiske, Principal Fairbairn, and
the distinguished General of the Confederate
Army, John B. Gordon, Senator from Georgia.
His lecture on "The Last Days of the Confederacy,"
was one of the great occasions of the season,
and it was noteworthy that many veterans of the
G. A. R. were among the loudest in their applause
when their foe of thirty years before came upon
the platform. Another event of the summer was
the visit of Governor William McKinley of Ohio,
a year before his nomination and election to the
Presidency. During this season also we were
entertained with readings by Professor S. H.
Clark, Mr. Will M. Carleton, and Miss Ida
Benfey.</p>

<p>In the year 1895 another movement was begun
at Chautauqua, which like the W. C. T. U. has
swept over the entire continent and wrought
mightily for the public welfare. At a Kindergarten
Mothers' Meeting during the session, Mrs.
Theodore W. Birney of Georgia, gave an address
urging a National Congress of Mothers, and her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
appeal awakened a prompt response. Many of
those who had listened to her carried her message
to their own home-towns; Mrs. Birney at women's
clubs and gatherings gave her plea over and over;
and when the General Federation of Women's
clubs held its convention in her native State of
Georgia she presented the proposition to the members.
From that convention in 1896, a call was
issued for a National Congress of Mothers, to be
held in the National Capital. Mrs. Birney gave
a year of tireless and wise preparation for the meeting,
which began on February 17, 1897. She was
called to be President of the National Congress, with
Miss Mary Louisa Butler as Organizing Secretary.
The work was aided by the wide-reaching influence
and liberal gifts of Mrs. Phebe A. Hearst, who has
been rightly called the Lady Bountiful of the
movement. Out of this National Congress grew
the holding of State-congresses in every part of
the country and the organization of local branches
in almost every city. The Congress of Mothers
now has its central office in Washington, D. C. It
is divided into twenty-five departments of work&mdash;such
as Americanization, Child Hygiene, Child
Labor, Education, Mothers' Circles, Thrift, and
many others, each having its chairman and plan
of effective work. Out of a meeting at Chautauqua,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
in 1895, has grown a nation-wide movement
in aid of mothers and teachers.</p>

<p>In 1896 the schools were again reorganized
under Dr. Harper's supervision. The School of
Fine Arts and the New York Summer Institute
for Teachers were new departments, the latter
under the direction of the Regents of the New York
State University. The School of Sacred Literature
was increased in its faculty, having among them
President Harper, Professor Shailer Mathews, and
Professor D. A. McClenahan of the United Presbyterian
Theological School. Prominent among the
lecturers this year were Dr. George Adam Smith
of Scotland, Dr. Gunsaulus, Rev. S. Parkes Cadman,
Dr. Booker T. Washington, Rev. Dr.
George A. Gordon, Dr. Charles F. Aked, then of
England, but soon to become an American, Professor
F. G. Peabody, Dr. Nicholas Murray Butler,
soon afterward the President of Columbia University,
and Dr. Russell H. Conwell. A lady appeared
on the platform whose experience had
been unlike that of any other woman in the land.
This was Mrs. Robert E. Peary, who accompanied
her husband on one of his North Pole explorations
and had a daughter born within the polar circle&mdash;"The
snow baby," as she was called. She gave a
lecture with stereopticon views descriptive of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
life in the frozen North. Another woman gave a
lecture this year upon her travels in Equatorial
Africa, Miss Jessie T. Ackerman. President
Charles W. Eliot of Harvard University gave the
oration on Recognition Day, his subject being
"America's Contribution to Civilization." In
looking through the list of the speakers on Recognition
Day, I find the names of no less than ten
college presidents, and also that of the Hon. William
T. Harris, United States Commissioner of
Education, who might be regarded as standing at
the head of the nation's educational system. The
value of Chautauqua as a force in education has
been fully recognized by the highest authorities.</p>

<div class="footnotes"><h3>FOOTNOTE:</h3>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_2_2" id="Footnote_2_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> From the <i>Handbook of Information</i> published by the Chautauqua
Institution (1918) we give the following extract. "The
Chautauqua tradition which taboos card playing and social
dancing, and the rule which forbids the sale or importation of
alcoholic beverages, disclose the influence which dominated the
early life of the Assembly. As to card playing and dancing, the
tradition is preserved not because all agree in condemning these
things in themselves, but because they are deemed unsuitable to
Chautauqua conditions and even hostile to its life. It is believed
that they would prove divisive and distracting, and that they
suggest a very different type of society from that which Chautauqua
seeks to set up for a few summer weeks. Chautauqua,
therefore, disapproves these diversions as not only unnecessary,
but as involving disintegrating influences. The fact that many
who indulge in these amusements at home express gratification
that they are not permitted at Chautauqua is significant."</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

<h3>ROUNDING OUT THE OLD CENTURY<br />
(1897-1900)</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Chautauqua session of 1897 was fifty-nine
days long, from June 26th to August 23rd. This
year the School of Domestic Science, directed by
Mrs. Emma P. Ewing, attracted attention. Almost
as many ladies whose cookery was accomplished
by servants, as those who broiled their
own steaks and baked their own puddings, met in
Mrs. Ewing's model kitchen, learning to make
bread, to prepare appetizing sauces and dressings,
and to learn how to serve tables with refinement.
I remember hearing one lady remark that until
she had received Mrs. Ewing's instruction she had
never really known how to make good bread.</p>

<p>Among those who gave lectures in 1897, we find
the names of Anna Howard Shaw, Ballington and
Maud Booth, Bishop (better known as Chaplain)
McCabe; quite a list of college presidents&mdash;Goucher
of Baltimore, Hyde of Bowdoin, Harper of
Chicago, John Finley of New York, and G. Stanley<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
Hall of Clark; also Professor Graham Taylor, Mr.
Percy Alden of England, and Mr. Jacob Riis. A
new reader of noble presence, rich voice, and rare
dramatic power, recited on the platform of the
Amphitheater and assisted in the School of Expression&mdash;Mrs.
Bertha Kunz Baker, who was to
entertain us through many years. Professor
Clark gave readings; Mr. George W. Cable rendered
a number of his own stories; Mrs. Jessie
Eldridge Southwick and Miss Katherine Oliver
also gave recitals.</p>

<p>After Dr. Vincent's election as Bishop in 1888,
he found it increasingly difficult to supervise the
ever-increasing work of Chautauqua. Often during
the Assembly season he would be compelled to
hold conferences in the far west, and one year in
South America. In 1896, his episcopal residence
was changed from Buffalo to Topeka, Kansas, and
in 1900 he was removed to Zurich, Switzerland, to
take charge of Methodist missions in Europe.
More and more he delegated the care of Chautauqua
to his son, who, one of the most popular
of lecturers, was supreme in his ability as administrator.
In 1898 Professor George E. Vincent
was formally appointed Principal of Instruction,
and very soon every department of Chautauqua,
both in its lecture platform and its educational<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
work, felt the touch of a master hand. Some of us
oldsters who had loved Chautauqua from its earliest
years, had felt anxious for its future as we saw
one of its Founders called aside into other fields,
and the other failing in strength, although we
knew not how near was his earthly end. But we
all had a sense of relief and confidence that the
future of Chautauqua was assured when we found
"George" taking his father's place as executive in
the Department of Instruction. The Bishop
retained the title of Chancellor, however, as long
as he lived.</p>

<p>In 1898 a new building was erected on College
Hill&mdash;The Hall of Pedagogy. The report of the
season's work showed that attendance had increased
in the schools twenty-five per cent. over
the last year, the advance being distributed quite
evenly among the departments. By this time
nearly all the universities and many of the colleges
were holding summer schools, yet Chautauqua,
first in the field, was still leading in its membership.
This year Chautauqua received a visit
from Lord Aberdeen, the Governor-General of the
Dominion of Canada, and his wife, the Countess.
Americans are apt to look for a freezing dignity
on the part of the higher nobility, and some were
a little surprised to find the Governor-General<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
and his Lady unreservedly approachable, and
unaffectedly democratic in manner.</p>

<p>Some of those who gave lectures in 1898 were
Dr. Richard T. Ely of the University of Wisconsin,
President Thirkield of Atlanta, afterward Bishop,
Dr. Moulton, Miss Jane Addams, Hon. Murat
Halstead, General John B. Eaton, Mr. Leon H.
Vincent, Bishop Daniel A. Goodsell, Dr. J. H.
Barrows, President of Oberlin, President Faunce
of Brown, Dr. Robert McIntyre, also to become a
Bishop in due time, Dr. Charles E. Jefferson of
New York, Dr. Amory H. Bradford of Montclair,
N. J., and Mr. John Kendrick Bangs. Mr.
Leland Powers was with us on his biennial visit,
and recitals were also rendered by Mr. C. F. Underhill,
Mr. John Fox, Miss Isabel Garghill, Mr.
Will Carleton, and Miss Ida Benfey. Up to that
date, the season of 1898 was one of the most successful
in Chautauqua history.</p>

<p>At this time, the <i>Chautauquan Magazine</i>, the
organ of the C. L. S. C., and the <i>Daily Assembly
Herald</i>, were taken over by the trustees, and the
<i>Chautauqua Press</i> was established as the publishing
agency for the periodicals and books of
the C. L. S. C. Mr. Frank Chapin Bray was
appointed Editor. By birth and education he was
a thorough Chautauquan, having, as it were,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
grown up on the ground from early childhood and
gone through all the courses from the Children's
Class to the C. L. S. C. As a small boy he had
sold the <i>Assembly Herald;</i> as a young man had
written for its columns, and he is not the only
journalist who took these steps upward to a
literary career.</p>

<p>The season of 1899 opened with a cloud hanging
over Chautauqua, bringing sorrow to one family
and deepest sympathy from many.</p>

<p>On February 17, 1899, Lewis Miller died in a
hospital in New York where he had been taken to
undergo an operation from which he failed to
rally. He was seventy years of age and had given
his whole heart and the best of his life to Chautauqua.
But for Lewis Miller there would have been
no Chautauqua, though there might have been an
Assembly under some other name. He had chosen
the place, had urged the location, and in its inception
had aided in its plans, had supervised its
business interests, and had contributed generously
to its needs. At the opening of the "Old First
Night" service in August, 1899, the white lilies
bloomed in his honor, but instead of being waved,
were held in solemn stillness for a full minute,
and then slowly lowered, and this memorial has
been observed on every "Old First Night" since.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
The names of Lewis Miller and John H. Vincent
stand together in equal honor as the two Founders
of Chautauqua. Next to these Founders we remember
on "Old First Night" two of the Vice-Presidents
of the Board of Trustees, the late
Francis H. Root of Buffalo, and Clem. Studebaker
of South Bend, Indiana, both wise
counsellors and generous givers to Chautauqua.</p>

<p>During the session of 1899, Theodore Roosevelt
was for the third time the guest of Chautauqua.
The war with Spain had come and gone; he had
been Colonel of the Rough Riders, and was now
Governor of New York. One of those Rough
Riders was young Theodore Miller, the son of the
Founder of Chautauqua, and the only Yale student
to lay down his life in that campaign. His memory
is preserved by the Miller Gate on the University
campus. Another Governor was with us that
summer, Robert L. Taylor of Tennessee. The
two brothers Taylor were the heads respectively
of the two political parties in their State, were
candidates opposed to each other, stumped the
State together, slept together every night, played
the violin together at their meetings, and then
after the concert, made their speeches against one
another. The writer of these pages may claim a
humble part in their careers, for both of them as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
boys, and also an older brother, were students
under his teaching in 1864 and '65 in Pennington
Seminary, New Jersey. We could tell some
stories about those three Taylor boys, but we refrain.
I think that the Republican Taylor, Alfred,
is even now (1920) the Governor of Tennessee, as
his brother was its Democratic Governor in 1899.</p>

<p>Another visitor of about this date, though we
are not certain of the precise year, was Mr.
Horace Fletcher, whose name is in the dictionary
in the word "Fletcherize," which means to count
the chewing of each mouthful thirty times before
swallowing it. We have tried some steaks in the
early Chautauquan days when fifty chews would
hardly make an impression. He spoke on the
platform, and the few who could hear him said
that his talk was not about dietetics, but foreign
politics, though the two words are somewhat alike
and they may have misunderstood him. His fiftieth
birthday came while he was at Chautauqua,
and he celebrated it by doing some amazing stunts,
double somersaults, etc., into the lake at the diving
place. I sat at the table next to his at the Athen&aelig;um
and noticed that he ate very slowly, but I
could not count the chews on each mouthful. A
lady at the same table told me that Mr. Fletcher
eschewed coffee but put seven lumps of sugar in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
his tea, calmly observing that his "system needed
sugar." I know some young people who have the
same opinion concerning their own systems, if one
may judge by the fate of a box of chocolates in
their hands.</p>

<p>In this year the School of Religious Teaching
was reorganized, the Department of Sacred Literature
being conducted by Chancellor Wallace of
Toronto, and that of Religious Pedagogy, by Dr.
J. R. Street. We may as well insert here the fact
that for many years before, and during the seasons
since that year, Sunday School lessons were taught
in the morning and a lecture given at the Park of
Palestine in the afternoon by the author of this
volume. The plan with the lessons has been to
give every morning a preview of a coming Sunday
School topic, so that by the close of the season all
the lessons for six months to come have been
taught, and at Palestine Park to treat the geography
of the land historically in a series of lectures.
Also, it should be remembered that every Sunday
of the Chautauqua season, from the first year, a
Sunday School has been held in the morning, for
all ages from youngest to oldest, the grades being
taught in different places on the grounds by
specialists in their several departments. For
some years, if one strayed on Sunday morning<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
over Palestine Park, he might find a class of boys
seated on the hills around Nazareth listening to a
lesson on the boyhood of Jesus, and a group of
girls looking down on the Sea of Galilee, while a
teacher was telling stories of the tempest stilled
and the five thousand fed.</p>

<p>Prominent upon the lecture platform in 1899
were Prof. C. T. Winchester, Dr. Charles E. Jefferson,
Prof. John Fiske, Prof. A. B. Hart, Bishop
C. B. Galloway of the Methodist Episcopal
Church, South, President Faunce, Dr. George
Adam Smith, Dr. E. E. Hale, and Governor
G. W. Atkinson of West Virginia. Mr. John
Kendrick Bangs was also on the platform with
readings.</p>

<p>The year 1900 rounded out a century, and one of
its outstanding events at Chautauqua was a
course of lectures by Principal Fairbairn of Oxford
on "The Nineteenth Century." He asserted that
in the ages to come, this hundred years will be
looked upon as perhaps the greatest of all the centuries
in the world's progress made during that
period. He spoke in turn upon the historical, the
political, the inventive, the literary, the religious,
and the philosophic progress, giving without a
written reminder names, dates, facts, processes of
thought in the widest range. Many regarded it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
as one of the ablest and most enlightening series of
addresses that they had ever heard.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i-382.jpg" width="600" height="315" alt="South Gymnasium" title="" />
<span class="caption">South Gymnasium</span>
</div>

<p>Among the new faces on the platform we saw
Dr. Lincoln Hulley, the new President of the
John B. Stetson University of Florida, an exceedingly
interesting speaker and a charming personality.
We heard also Mr. Edward Howard Griggs
in a series of lectures in the Amphitheater, and an
appreciative class also met him in the school. From
1900 until the present, Mr. Griggs has given us
biennial courses, and on "Old First Night" his tall
form rises and sits down as the record is made up
for every alternate year. No lecturer on thoughtful
subjects has more engagements or brings together
larger audiences than Mr. Griggs. Dean
Charles D. Williams of Trinity Cathedral, and in a
few years Bishop (Protestant Episcopal) of Detroit,
an independent thinker and powerful preacher,
welcomed both on the platform and in the pulpit
many times since that appearance, his first among
us. I think also that Professor Bliss Perry of
Harvard spoke for the first time this season, also
President Benjamin Ide Wheeler. Others who
came as old friends were Prof. Moses Coit Tyler,
President Henry Churchill King, Dr. Graham
Taylor, Dr. Cadman, Mr. Edward Howard Griggs,
Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt, Miss Susan B. Anthony,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
and Miss Jane Addams. I must not forget
that this summer Mr. Francis Wilson was with us
again, and gave a lecture upon Eugene Field and
his poetry, an appreciation inspired by friendship
as well as literary insight. On a former visit to
Chautauqua Francis Wilson not only joined the
C. L. S. C., but formed a reading circle in his
dramatic company, directing their studies and
holding their literary meetings in railroad stations,
in hotel parlors, and in the green rooms of theaters,
wherever they chanced to be when the meeting
day arrived.</p>

<p>On August 7, 1900, the corner stone of the Hall
of Christ, "Aula Christi," was laid. The address
on that occasion was given by Bishop James M.
Thoburn of India. Bishop Vincent was now living
overseas in Zurich, Switzerland, and could not be
present. The stone was laid by Principal George
E. Vincent and a telegram from his father was
read. This Hall was one of the creations of
Bishop Vincent's poetic mind. He aimed to make
it a building not large, but beautiful, a sort of
shrine, a chapel for meditation and prayer, a
place of quiet, spiritual fellowship, not of class
teaching, but of thoughtful addresses on themes
directly relating to our Lord. Bishop Vincent
did not possess the genius for raising large sums of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
money for his conceptions; he shrank from pressing
them upon rich men. Another projector would
have ventured boldly, demanded contributions
and obtained them, to build the Hall at once; but
Dr. Vincent was delicate in speaking of it, though
all knew his ardent desires for this ideal. The
building grew slowly as gifts were received. Begun
in 1899, it was not dedicated until 1912. Although
no thought of his own honor in this building was
in the Founder's mind, yet to many it stands as
his monument at Chautauqua. Most appropriately
it is used as the center for the Department of
Religious Work, and daily lectures are given within
its walls on Biblical themes.</p>

<p>As Dr. George Vincent was now an associate
professor in the University of Chicago, it became
necessary for him to have some assistance in the
management of the Chautauqua program and
platform. Mr. Scott Brown was this year appointed
General Director and Vice-Principal of
Instruction.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>

<h3>OPENING THE NEW CENTURY<br />
(1901-1904)</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> season of 1901 was the longest of any
thus far, sixty days, from July 1st to August 29th.
In the schools Manual Training was introduced
under the direction of Mr. Henry J. Baker, also
a school of Library Training under the general
guidance of Mr. Melvil Dewey, at that time New
York State Librarian, and soon after made one of
the Chautauqua trustees. The resident director
of this school was at first Miss Mary E. Hazeltine
of Jamestown; later, and up to the present time,
Miss Mary E. Downey, of the Utah State Library.
The growth of public libraries throughout the
country has made this school very popular among
young women seeking the profession of librarian.</p>

<p>Some voices new to Chautauqua were heard
from the Amphitheater platform in 1901, such as
Dr. O. P. Gifford of the Baptist Church, Captain
Richmond Pearson Hobson, Mrs. L. Ormiston
Chant of England, a descendant of the great<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
Edmund Burke, we were informed, and the Governor
of New York, Hon. Benjamin B. Odell. Mr.
Joseph Jefferson, whom all the world of that generation
knew as "Rip Van Winkle," gave a lecture
showing the relations of the lecture platform and
the stage. Rev. John McNeill, whose speech
showed that he came from the north of the Tweed,
preached a powerful and searching sermon. Dr.
Robert Stuart McArthur gave a lecture on
"Mountain Peaks in Russian History." Dr.
Hale, President Crawford, Mr. Leland Powers,
Dr. S. H. Clark, Dr. Moulton, and Mr. George W.
Bain were among the old Chautauqua favorites of
that season. As the C. L. S. C. Class of 1900 had
taken the name "The Nineteenth Century Class,"
the one graduating this year was entitled "The
Twentieth Century Class." The speaker on
Recognition Day was Chancellor E. Benjamin
Andrews of the University of Nebraska, on the
subject, "Problems of Greater America."</p>

<p>The season of 1902 was noteworthy from a visit
of Bishop Vincent. It seems strange to read of a
<i>visit</i> from the Founder of Chautauqua, but he was
at that time living in Zurich, Switzerland, holding
Methodist conferences all over Europe, in many
languages through interpreters, and for several
years had been absent from Chautauqua. We of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
the older generation always missed his presence,
but to the younger troop of Chautauquans his was
only a revered name. The Vincent whom they
knew, and packed the Amphitheater to hear, was
the Director George E. Vincent, the man at the
wheel of Chautauqua. This year the announcement
was made that the Chancellor was coming,
and a royal welcome was prepared. A printed
account of this event reads as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Arriving at Lakewood, the Bishop was met by members
of his family, and the Board of Trustees. After
the welcome greetings, the party took a special steamer
for Chautauqua. At the Pier a fleet of craft of
all descriptions&mdash;launches, sail-boats, and row-boats&mdash;awaited
the arrival of the Bishop's steamer. As
soon as it came within hailing distance, the larger
boats dipped colors and all the people waved handkerchiefs,
the chimes at the Point rang in a familiar
tune, and as the steamer headed toward the Pier, the
Chautauqua choir, gathered in the balcony, sang the
old Chautauqua song, "Join, O friends, in a memory
song."</p>

<p>As the boat came to the wharf, the bank and the
Park of Palestine were a mass of waving handkerchiefs.
The Reception Committee, composed of officials
of the Institution, stood on the Pier, and back
of them an immense throng all eager to catch a glimpse
of their beloved leader. Lines were formed on either
side of the walk, and as the Bishop passed between
them he was greeted with the salute of the white<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
handkerchiefs. In Miller Park were gathered the
cottage owners, the Summer Schools, and the C. L. S.
C. classes, with their banners and emblems, and the
various clubs and children's classes. On the way to his
cottage on Lake Avenue, the Bishop was escorted by
about two hundred and fifty members of the Boys'
and Girls' Clubs, whose sweet voices rang out clear
and full in "Auld Lang Syne." From the veranda
of his tent cottage, the Bishop made an eloquent address
of appreciation, full of the joy of home-coming.</p></div>

<p>In 1904, Bishop Vincent was placed on the retired
list, to dwell where he chose, free from episcopal
service. From that year until 1918, he passed
a portion of each summer at Chautauqua and took
part in the program, but without the responsibility
of supervision. Most of the time he was
happy in his release, but there would come occasional
hours when he longed to hold the reins once
more.</p>

<p>In this year, 1902, a new charter was received
from the Legislature of New York, giving a new
title, "Chautauqua Institution." The Girls'
Club and the Unitarian House were built this
season, also the Disciples' Headquarters on Clark
Avenue received its pillared portico. The Lutheran
House was established during this season.</p>

<p>Senator Mark Hanna of Ohio, who was looked
upon as "the power behind the throne" during<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
the presidency of his friend, William McKinley,
spoke at Chautauqua in 1902, also Mrs. Pennybacker
of Texas, Dr. A. E. Dunning of Boston,
editor of the <i>Congregationalist</i>, General John C.
Black of Pennsylvania, Dr. Earl Barnes, Prof.
Charles Zeublin, Dr. W. F. Oldham of India, afterward
a Bishop, and the ever-welcome Frank
Beard who had been absent for a number of years.</p>

<p>Chautauqua has always believed in the open
and free discussion of vexed questions, and this year
from August 4th to August 8th was held a most
interesting conference on "The Labor Movement."
The introductory address opening the subject was
given by the Hon. Carroll D. Wright, U. S. Commissioner
of Labor. Supplementary lectures, followed
by discussion, were by President Harper on
"The University and Industrial Education";
Mr. Frank P. Sargent, "Growth and Influence of
Labor Organizations"; Mr. John Mitchell, "The
Joint Conference between Employer and Employee."
On both sides there was the frankest
expression of opinion. I remember that when one
speaker was asked whether he was an actual
worker or a professional agitator, without a word
he held out his hands that all might see they were
the hands of a working-man.</p>

<p>This year was notable in the Department of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
Music, by the entrance of Mr. Alfred Hallam as
Director. His whole-hearted, absolutely self-forgetting
labor, and his reach after the highest
standards in his art, from 1902 to 1919, made Mr.
Hallam dear not only to his choir, but to all
Chautauquans.</p>

<p>The year 1903 was the twenty-fifth anniversary
of the founding of the C. L. S. C. in 1878. That
event in popular education was commemorated by
a great meeting in the Amphitheater and the laying
of the corner stone of a new Hall of Philosophy
on the site of the old hall, which, being a wooden
building, was decaying. The Class of 1882 planted
some ivy brought from the Palatine Hill in Rome,
other classes planted oak and pine trees. A
sealed box, containing portraits of the Founders
and copies of Chautauqua publications, was placed
in the corner stone, which was then lowered into
place and made secure with mortar, the trowel
being handled in turn by Dr. George Vincent and
Director Scott Brown. As the stone was put in
place, a cablegram was read from Bishop Vincent
at Helsingfors, Finland&mdash;"Remember the foundation
is Christ." Vincent.</p>

<p>This year, 1903, the Arts and Crafts shops,
which had been in various places over the ground,
were brought together by the director, Henry<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
Turner Bailey, making the Arts and Crafts Village,
in later years to become the Arts and Crafts
Building. The Grange Building on Simpson
Avenue was erected and presented as headquarters
for that order by Mr. Cyrus W. Jones of Jamestown.
This year, 1903, Dean Percy H. Boynton
of the University of Chicago was made Secretary
of Instruction, and placed in full charge of the
Summer Schools, which by this time had grown to
more than two thousand students. A few years
later he received the title of Principal and gave to
the summer schools his unremitting attention
until 1917. To Dean Boynton's careful choice
of instructors and watchfulness over details of
management during those years the growth and
success of the schools is largely due.</p>

<p>The Liquor Problem was the subject of the Conference
on August 3-8, 1903. I find on the list of
speakers and their subjects eight names to which
might be added five times as many who participated
in the discussions. Commander Frederick
Booth-Tucker and his wife Emma Booth-Tucker,
told of "The Salvation Army and the Liquor
Problem." Mr. Raymond Robins, an eminent
social worker of Chicago, spoke on "The Saloon
and the World of Graft, Vagrancy, and Municipal
Correction," although it may have been "municipal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
corruption," for I think he spoke on both subjects.
Mrs. Lillian M. N. Stevens told of the work
of the W. C. T. U.; Prof. I. P. Bishop showed "The
Physiological Effects of Alcohol," Prof. Frederick
Starr, the anthropologist, gave an interesting account
of "Stimulants among Primitive Peoples."
Other speakers were Rev. E. C. Dinwiddie, Mr.
Frederick H. Wines, and Mrs. John G. Woolley.</p>

<img src="images/i-394.jpg" width="600" height="331" alt="A Corner of the Playground" title="" />
<span class="caption">A Corner of the Playground</span>
</div>

<p>Another Conference was held August 10th to
15th on "The Mob," and attracted the deepest
interest. President William G. Frost of Berea
College, Kentucky, told of "The Mountain
Feuds"; Mr. John Temple Graves spoke in defense
of lynching, and declared that the only solution of
the negro problem in the south would be the enforced
deportation of the negro back to Africa;
but other Southerners present did not agree with
him. Dean Richmond Babbitt gave "A Study
of the Lynch Law"; Mr. D. M. Parry spoke on
"The Mob Spirit in Organized Labor"; Mr.
Thomas Kidd on "The Labor Unions and the
Mob Spirit." Chief Justice Charles B. Lore of
Delaware and Judge John Woodward gave "The
Legal Aspects of the Mob Spirit." No discussion
at Chautauqua awakened such feeling, although
it was carried on with perfect courtesy by speakers
on the opposing sides.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span></p>

<p>We can name only a few of the many lecturers
in the regular program of 1903. One was Governor
Robert M. La Follette of Wisconsin, soon to
attract attention as an insurgent in the United
States Senate. Another was Mr. George Willis
Cooke, on social subjects. Mr. Hamlin Garland,
the story-writer, gave a lecture, also General John
B. Gordon of Georgia, Dr. Richard Burton, a
course in literature; Hon. Wm. T. Harris, Dr.
Moulton, and the Rev. R. J. Campbell of London.
The platform during the season was fairly crowded,
the speakers and concerts following in such close
succession.</p>

<p>In 1904, Bishop Vincent having been relieved
from the cares of the Episcopacy, went to live for a
time in Indianapolis. He was now able to come
with more or less regularity to Chautauqua, and
gave the opening address of the season. The exercises
of that year extended through sixty days
beginning June 30th and ending August 28th.
We note that the School of English included in its
staff Prof. Richard G. Moulton and Edward
Howard Griggs. The work in Nature Study was
enlarged to include courses in Botany and Physiography.
The courses for teachers embraced
systematic work in all the grades from the kindergarten
to the college. This year the new electric<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
railway was opened from Jamestown to Chautauqua
and thence to Mayville and Westfield on Lake
Erie. Bishop Vincent was a passenger on the first
car over the line. This improved means of transportation
enabled people to come by rail every
hour to Chautauqua, gave direct and speedy connection
with the New York Central Railroad, and
resulted in making the principal entrance to the
grounds no longer by water but by land. Hence
the crowds forsook the stores in the Pier Building
and the Arcade, and a new business center grew
up on the hill.</p>

<p>This year the new Hall of Philosophy was
opened, of the same general plan as the old building,
but with floor and pillars of concrete, a more
durable material. The building was also somewhat
larger than its predecessor and was in every
way more convenient. In the concrete floor are
inserted tablets in honor of the classes that contributed
toward the building. The pillars also
bear the names of their givers. The list of exercises
in the Hall during any Assembly season would
of itself make a long catalogue.</p>

<p>The Devotional Hour had now become a systematic
order and called together large congregations.
It was not altogether the fame of the great
preachers, but also the strong religious atmosphere<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
of the place that gathered every day at ten o'clock
for five mornings of each week a thousand people
for worship. How many churches could show a
congregation as large, not only on Sundays, when
the service was attended by five thousand people,
but through the days of the week? Among the
chaplains of this season, each serving a week, were
Dr. S. Parkes Cadman, Dr. Hugh Black, Bishop
Oldham, Dr. Daniel Dorchester of Pittsburgh,
and the evangelist, Dr. J. Wilbur Chapman.</p>

<p>The Conference of 1904 was from July 24th to
29th on the subject of Missions, Home and
Foreign. Among the speakers were Dr. Francis
E. Clark of the Christian Endeavor movement,
recently returned from an all-around the world visit
to missions abroad, Dr. Frederick G. Stanley,
Dr. George M. Boynton, Dr. Homer Stuntz from
the Philippines&mdash;afterward a Bishop of the Methodist
Episcopal Church&mdash;Bishop Oldham, and Mr.
J. L. Joslin of India.</p>

<p>I remember hearing Dr. Stuntz tell of a native
Filipino who came to him soon after the American
occupation of Manila, and after carefully closing
the door, and looking in closets to be sure that no
one was in hearing, carefully unrolled a package,
showed a small Bible in the Spanish language, and
asked: "Would it be safe for me to be found reading<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
this book? I have kept it hidden for years,
for my life would have been the penalty if it had
been seen." Dr. Stuntz led him to a window,
pointed to the American flag flying over the castle,
and said; "Do you see that flag? As long as that
flag flutters over these islands, you can stand in
the market place and read in as loud a voice as you
choose out of this book and you will be safe.
Wherever that flag flies, the Bible is an open
book!"</p>

<p>Most of the men whom we have named gave lectures,
as well as participating in the conferences.
Besides these, we saw on the platform the massive
form of William Howard Taft, then Secretary of
War, after a few years to be President of the
United States; Mr. Griggs also gave a course of
lectures and taught classes in literature, and Prof.
Frederick Starr was one of the speakers. Dr.
George Adam Smith of Scotland was also with us
during the season of 1904.</p>

<p>Some of the recitations this year were by Dr.
S. H. Clark, Mrs. Bertha Kunz Baker, Mrs.
Emily M. Bishop, Miss Marie L. Shedlock, and
Prof. Henry L. Southwick.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>

<h3>PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT AT CHAUTAUQUA<br />(1905-1908)</h3>




<p><span class="smcap">The</span> notable event in the Assembly of 1905 was
the fourth visit of Theodore Roosevelt. He was
the President of the United States, not now by
succession, but by direct vote of the people, for his
first term, after the death of Mr. McKinley, had
been completed. He had promised to maintain
his predecessor's policies during the period for
which Mr. McKinley had been elected, and
through that term he had initiated no new movements.
But his pledge having been kept and his
administration ratified by the popular vote, Mr.
Roosevelt was now free to bring forward his own
plans. His address at Chautauqua on August
11th, five months after his inauguration, was the
first public announcement of his principles and
policies, and in its boldness, its candor, and its
originality was fairly startling. Mr. McKinley
was a cordial, but a reticent party leader. Everyone
who talked with him was charmed, but no one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
could recall any definite promise or statement that
he had made. Mr. Roosevelt was absolutely,
unreservedly open; he would state to anybody his
opinion on every public question. Lyman Abbott
once said, "Mr. McKinley and Mr. Roosevelt
were both great men and great statesmen, but
between the absolute reticence of the one and the
absolutely openness of the other, there is no half-way
house."</p>

<p>The presidential party included his son Kermit,
his nephew Paul Roosevelt, his cousin Philip
Roosevelt, Mr. Jacob A. Riis, and a number of
leading politicians, besides secret service men, and
the inevitable troop of newspaper reporters. They
were met at Lakewood by Bishop Vincent, his son
the Principal, and representatives of the Chautauqua
Board. A breakfast was served to the party
and to some invited guests in Higgins Hall. I sat
beside a prominent politician who said to me that
on the train and boat he was absolutely amazed
at the knowledge of President Roosevelt upon
every subject, and his readiness to state his views
upon even the deepest matters of State. At the
table I noticed Dr. James M. Buckley sitting beside
the President and in earnest conversation
with him. As we passed out of the Hall, I mentioned
to Dr. Buckley what the public man had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
told me of Mr. Roosevelt's outspoken candor, and
Dr. Buckley said that the President had answered
every question in utter frankness, evidently having
nothing to conceal; and Dr. Buckley could
ask searching questions.</p>

<p>The adage, "It sometimes rains at Chautauqua,"
was verified that day by a steady downpour, which
with the umbrellas lifted over the moving procession
made every avenue, seen from an upper balcony,
look like an endless serpent with a series of
bulging black knobs on his back. No words can
express the jam of people in and around the Amphitheater
and the breathless interest with which all
listened to the President's address, which came
like a revelation, with its outspoken utterances
upon subjects hitherto held as State secrets. He
talked of our relations with nations abroad, and of
problems at home, the trusts, questions of capital
and labor, and, indeed, every subject under discussion
at that time. A statesman once said,
"Language was invented to conceal thought," but
that was certainly not the use of language by one
eminent American. As Mr. Roosevelt was leaving
the Amphitheater, he saw the Boys' Club
standing together, on guard, and he gave them a
short, appreciative, practical speech.</p>

<p>Some of the speakers at the Assembly of 1905<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
were District Attorney William Travers Jerome of
New York, Governor Joseph W. Folk of Missouri,
the Hon. Robert Watchorn, Commissioner of Immigration,
President Charles Cuthbert Hall of
the Union Theological Seminary of New York,
recently home from giving addresses in India and
China under the auspices of the Parliament of
Religion, President Rush Rhees of the University
of Rochester, President Herbert Welch of Ohio
Wesleyan, Dean Charles D. Williams&mdash;on his
next visit to be a Bishop&mdash;and Dr. Richard Burton.
Mrs. Bertha Kunz Baker, Dr. S. H. Clark,
Mr. Leland Powers, and others entertained us
with readings and impersonations; but it should
also be said that the leading elocutionists at Chautauqua
made it a large part of their task to acquaint
us with great literature, both in poetry, in
prose, and especially in the drama.</p>

<p>In 1905 the Colonnade Building was built and
became the business center of Chautauqua. During
this season Mr. Scott Brown, the General
Director under Principal George E. Vincent, called
into the service of the Chautauqua Institution, as
assistant, a young man to become in a few years
his successor, Mr. Arthur E. Bestor. Mr. Bestor
also began lecturing upon the platform in a course
on "Studies in American Diplomacy."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span></p>

<p>In the report of the year 1906, I notice a custom
that is mentioned for the first time this year,
though it may have been observed before. On the
opening night, June 28, signal fires were lighted
at prominent points around the lake, notifying
the summer residents, whose cottages by this
year were girdling Lake Chautauqua, that the
Assembly had now begun for another season.
This illumination has been followed every year
since 1906, and appropriately gives notice to every
village between Mayville and Jamestown that the
light of Chautauqua has begun to shine.</p>

<p>The program of July we find as full as that of
August. During the earlier month were lectures
and addresses by Professor F. Hyatt Smith on
"Eminent Englishmen of the Nineteenth Century"&mdash;Coleridge,
Macaulay, Carlyle, Matthew Arnold,
and others; literary lectures by Leon H. Vincent,
who was now "Doctor of Letters," Mr. Henry
Turner Bailey, head of the Arts and Crafts, but
lecturer on many subjects; Newell Dwight Hillis
of Plymouth Church, Brooklyn; Dr. W. J. Dawson,
an English preacher and author who had
lately come to live in America, equally great in
the pulpit and in literature; Dr. S. C. Schmucker,
one who could make a scientific subject plain to
the lay-mind; Dr. John T. McFarland, head of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
the Sunday School work of the Methodist Episcopal
Church; Mrs. Donald McLean, President-General
of the Daughters of the American Revolution,
and other speakers.</p>

<p>During August a most interesting course of
lectures was given by Mr. John Graham Brooks
on "America Viewed by Outside People"&mdash;showing
how the estimates of our country, especially
by English writers, had arisen from
almost contemptuous criticism (much of it deserved,
it must be admitted) to high appreciation.
Mr. Griggs gave a new course of literary
lectures. Bishop Vincent gave a lecture on Martin
Luther. Prof. Cecil F. Lavell spoke on historical
subjects. Sir Chentung Lieng Chang, the Ambassador
from China, graduate of an American
college, Amherst, I think&mdash;was a visitor and spoke
in excellent English. Prof. Edward A. Steiner,
the great authority on immigration, lectured on
"Our Foreign Population," and told a remarkable
story of a journey that he had made through
underground Russia, visiting nearly a hundred
revolutionary centers. Mr. Ernest Thompson
Seton talked on wild animals, to the enjoyment of
both young and old.</p>

<p>On Recognition Day of the C. L. S. C., August 15,
1906, the new Hall of Philosophy was dedicated.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1907 Professor George E. Vincent was made
President of the Chautauqua Institution. His
father retained the title of Chancellor, but the active
duties of the management were now entirely
in the hands of the President. In the following
year, Mr. Arthur E. Bestor was advanced to the
place formerly held by Mr. Scott Brown, that of
Senior Director in charge of all business administrations
and assisting President Vincent on the
educational side.</p>

<p>A man who made his mark deeply on Chautauqua
came this year for the first time, Mr. Henry
Turner Bailey of the Arts and Crafts School. He
could not only teach, but could lecture on art or
history in a most fascinating manner, all the time
drawing pictures on the blackboard with both
hands at once. Under his care the Arts and
Crafts shops were assembled, grew into a village,
and later found their home in a series of fine buildings
on College Hill. He continued with us year
after year until a new position in Cleveland, Ohio,
compelled him to sever relations with Chautauqua.</p>

<p>Two great conferences were held this summer.
The first was on "The Juvenile Problem," July
8th-13th. Speakers on the subject were Rev. W.
Byron Forbush on "The Knights of King Arthur,"
an order of which he was the founder; Mr. W. R.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
George, on "The George Junior Republic"; Judge
Ben B. Lindsey of Denver on "The Juvenile
Court." Mr. Melvil Dewey, Rev. Crawford
Jackson, Judge Willis Brown and Mr. E. B.
DeGrott spoke on "Public Playgrounds," "The
Public Library," "The Child and the State," and
kindred subjects.</p>

<p>The other conference was held July 29th to
August 3d, on "The Social Unrest." A few of
the speakers and their topics were: Mr. John
Graham Brooks on "The Challenge of Socialism";
Mr. James Wadsworth, Jr., afterward U. S.
Senator from New York, on "Politics"; Mr. R. R.
Bowker on "The Corporation"; Mr. Henry Clews
on "Capital"; Mr. J. G. Phelps Stokes and his
wife, Rose Pastor Stokes, on "A Defense of Socialism";
Bishop Henry C. Potter, "The Church";
Mr. Charles Stelzle, "The Church and the
Classes"; Miss Jane Addams on "The Settlement
Movement."</p>

<p>On the regular lecture platform appeared
Governor Charles E. Hughes of New York, Mr.
William Jennings Bryan who had just returned
from a trip around the world and spoke on "The
Old World and Its Ways," President G. Stanley
Hall a series on "Five Non-Christian Religions,"
President George E. Vincent on "Utopias," a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
series describing the ideals of men for the community
and the state from Plato's <i>Republic</i> to
the Community of Robert Dale Owen. Bishop
Vincent also gave a lecture, the father and the son
speaking on different days from the same <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'platfrom'">platform</ins>.
My recollection is that the Bishop spoke this summer
on "Sidney Lanier and His Poetry," and
placed him high on the roll of American poets.</p>

<p>Another lecturer who pleased us all was the
bright essayist, Samuel McChord Crothers. His
paper on "The Society for Polite Unlearning"
was heard by a crowd in the Hall of Philosophy.
Most of the audience caught the undertone of wisdom
with the wit, but a few thought that it was
only funny, in which they were mistaken. Dr.
Shailer Mathews, Dr. C. F. Aked, and Bishop
McDowell were among those who conducted the
daily Devotional Services.</p>

<p>Grand Army Day was a dramatic occasion in
the fact that before an audience of old Union soldiers,
in their G. A. R. uniforms, the address was
given by Mrs. LaSalle Corbell Pickett, the widow
of General George Edward Pickett of the Confederate
Army, who led the famous "Pickett's
Charge" in the battle of Gettysburg&mdash;an attack
that stands in history beside the "Charge of the
Light Brigade," sung by Tennyson. Her story<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
of that great day, deciding the destiny of a continent,
was listened to, not merely with interest,
but with outbreaking enthusiasm by an audience
of Union soldiers, who honored the memory of a
soldier whom they looked upon less as a foe than
as a hero.</p>

<p>One little incident told by Mrs. Pickett we must
make room for; in substance it was this: On Lee's
march through Pennsylvania, Pickett's division
passed a young girl who waved a United States
flag, and then, fastening it around her waist,
cried, "Traitors! come and touch this flag if you
dare!" At this fierce challenge, a mingled stir of
many voices went through the long gray ranks and
many a rifle shifted uneasily. General Pickett
rode in front of his men, and with true southern
chivalry saluted her flag. Then he turned and
faced his men. The soldiers followed his example,
and as they passed by, every hat was swung aloft
in honor of the girl and her flag. The little maiden
was so overcome by this generosity that she cried
out, "I wish I had a rebel flag; I'd wave that too!"</p>

<p>In October, 1907, the Colonnade Building, which
had been standing only two years, was wholly
destroyed by fire, causing a loss of $100,000, with
an insurance of about $55,000. The indirect loss
is not easy to estimate, for it included the contents<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
of the stores and the issues of the Magazine ready
for mailing, with much other printed matter of the
Institution. This was the fourth fire which had
occurred during the thirty-four years of Chautauqua;
a remarkable record when one remembers
how close together are many of the houses, and all
built of wood. Plans for rebuilding the Colonnade
were taken up immediately, also the beginning
of a quadrangle of buildings for the Arts and
Crafts Department and the erection of a Post
Office Building.</p>

<p>In 1908 the July program included the names of
Professor J. E. McFadyen of Knox College,
Toronto, Principal James Robertson of Scotland,
and Dr. W. L. Watkinson of England; all these in
the Department of Religious Work, which was unusually
strong that year. Dr. Watkinson looked
the least like an Englishman that could be imagined.
Long and lank and lean, he might have
been taken for a Yankee of the Yankees, until he
began to speak. His oratory is indescribable,
original thoughts expressed in original language,
with here and there a solemn witticism at which
the hearer wanted to laugh but hardly dared to.
Bishop Vincent gave a lecture on "An Old School
House." Dr. H. W. Wiley, the food specialist
and foe of misbranded packages of food, gave an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
address. Norman Hapgood of <i>Collier's Magazine</i>,
Hon. Everett Colby of New Jersey, a leader in
political reform, Prof. Graham Taylor, a sociologist
and social reformer, were among the speakers.</p>

<p>In August of 1908, a notable English lady spoke
on the Amphitheater platform, Mrs. Philip Snowden,
wife of a member of Parliament. It was
said that her husband owed his election to her
power of public speaking, and especially to her
skill in answering "heckling" questions&mdash;a political
method quite common in England, though
regarded as not quite proper in America. In
our country when one party holds a meeting, it
is not considered fair to interrupt the flow of
oratory and disconcert the orator by disagreeable
questions from the other side; but in Great
Britain every political speaker must face such
enquirers, and the one who put them to little Mrs.
Snowden generally got the worst of the encounter.
Though slight and seemingly fragile, speaking
apparently without effort, every syllable of
her speeches on the question of woman's enfranchisement
could be distinctly heard from every
seat in the Amphitheater. Other speakers in
August, 1908, were Lieut.-Governor Chanler of
New York, Edward Howard Griggs, Prof. Charles
M. Cobern, an authority on Biblical arch&aelig;ology,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
Dr. Leon H. Vincent in a course on "French
Literary Celebrities," President J. D. Moffatt of
Washington and Jefferson College, Pennsylvania,
Charles Stelzle on social rights and wrongs, and
George Riddle in some enjoyable recitations.
Percy Alden, M.P., spoke on "Social and Economic
Questions" in England and Charles F. Lavell
gave a course on historical lectures. Dr. R. S.
MacArthur and Dr. J. Wilbur Chapman were
among the preachers and leaders of the Devotional
Hour.</p>

<p>August 11, 1908, was Pennsylvania Day, with
addresses in praise of the Keystone State by
Governor E. G. Stuart, Ex-Governor and General
J. A. Beaver, and others.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>

<h3>THE PAGEANT OF THE PAST<br />(1909-1912)</h3>




<p><span class="smcap">The</span> thirty-sixth session of Chautauqua was
epoch making in the development of material
resources. The blackened ruins of the burned
Colonnade Building were replaced by a new
structure, the official headquarters of the Institution,
the business center, and on its upper floor
a rooming place for many employees in the offices.
On the southern front of the Plaza arose the new
Post Office Building, with the village public library,
the presses and office of the <i>Chautauqua Press</i>.
The first section of the projected Arts and Crafts
quadrangle was built, to the great joy of Mr.
Bailey, who had labored and almost fought for
its construction. The Hall of Pedagogy arose at
one end of the grounds and the Athletic Club
House at the other. The Hall of the Christ was
completed after many years of slow growth, and
the Commons, a boarding-place for students, was
opened through all the year for employees residing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
during the winter. As a venture, with some
questioning, the New York Symphony Orchestra
was engaged for a week of concerts, its leader being
Walter Damrosch. Who would have dreamed in
1909 that in 1920 the same orchestra would sound
its harmonies through six full weeks!</p>

<p>The keynote of the year, and indeed of Chautauqua
through all its history, was expressed in
President George E. Vincent's utterance in his
annual report&mdash;that Chautauqua must "be kept
in close and sympathetic connection with the great
currents of national life. It must be a center
from which the larger and more significant movements
may gain strength and intelligent support."
The season this year opened on Friday, July 2d,
with a lecture by President Vincent on "Vocation
and Culture."</p>

<p>To even name the speakers of the year and their
subjects would necessitate the enlargement of our
book, and to omit any of them may bring the
author into peril of his life if he should meet any of
those left out; but he must face the prospect of a
martyr's end, by naming only a few. President
Edwin Earle Sparks, of the Pennsylvania State
College, gave a series of lectures on American
history; Prof. Archer B. Hulbert on "The Military
Conquest of the Alleghanies"; Prof. Stockton<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
Axson on "Literary Leaders"; Dr. Andrew Sloan
Draper, Superintendent of Education for New
York State, spoke, also Prof. George Albert Coe,
Prof. Clyde W. Votaw, and Dr. Richard M. Hodge&mdash;these
four on subjects relating to education;
Mr. Earl Barnes gave a course of lectures, besides
teaching in the schools; Booker T. Washington,
President Frank R. Sanders, Dr. P. S. Henson,
Prof. Henry F. Cope, Mr. Ernest Hamlin Abbott,
of <i>The Outlook</i>, and many more were with us in
July, 1908.</p>

<p>In August we heard Prof. Richard Burton in a
course of literary lectures; Dr. George Adam Smith,
Richard G. Moulton, and J. M. Thoburn, Jr., a
nephew of Bishop Thoburn, also Bishop Samuel
Fallows of the Reformed Episcopal Church,
and the Rev. Samuel A. Eliot, a son of the Harvard
President. Mr. S. S. McClure gave an offhand
conversational address on "The Making of a
Magazine," the story of his own experience.</p>

<p>The Devotional Hour was by this year firmly
fixed in the Chautauqua system. The Chaplain
preached on Sunday morning, at the great Amphitheater
service, and at ten o'clock for five days
following gave an address on some religious topic.
Among our chaplains during the season of 1908
were Dr. Charles E. Jefferson of New York, Prof.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
Herbert L. Willett of the University of Chicago,
President Herbert Welch, and Dr. R. H. Conwell.
The Recognition address to the graduating class of
the C. L. S. C. was by President Faunce of Brown
University on "Ideals of Modern Education."</p>

<p>This year a course in Esperanto, the proposed
world-language, was conducted, and the second
Esperanto Congress of America was held at
Chautauqua. Not having studied the language
and being too busy to attend the convention, the
writer is unable to state whether the lectures were
given in that tongue or in English, the inferior
language which Esperanto is expected to displace.
Probably two or three hundred years hence
Shakespeare's plays, Milton's poems, and Mark
Twain's stories will be known only in that language,
English being a quarry for arch&aelig;ological research
with about as many students as Greek or Sanscrit
has to-day.</p>

<p>An event of 1901 which attracted crowds from all
Chautauqua County and its surroundings was the
historical pageant of scenes in the history of Chautauqua
Lake. It included scenes from the Indian
Wars before the Revolution, the French explorers,
the British and American soldiers of the Revolutionary
period, and the settlement of the shores.
This was followed by the rendition of a play, <i>The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
Little Father of the Wilderness</i>, by Francis Wilson
and his company. The concerts of the preceding
year by the New York Symphony Orchestra,
under Walter Damrosch, had been so successful
that the management brought them for a second
visit in 1910.</p>

<p>One distinguished visitor in 1910 was the Right
Honorable James Bryce, Ambassador of Great
Britain to our country. His lecture was on
"History and Politics." Dr. S. M. Crothers gave
four lectures in his own inimitable manner on
"The One Hundred Worst Books." He proposed
as an interesting question, "Suppose that twenty
centuries hence, when the English language may be
as dead as Latin and Greek are now, what authors
in English literature will be remembered?" Director
Bestor found time in the midst of his labors
to give us a fine lecture on "Gladstone." Paul
Vincent Harper, son of President Harper, spoke on
"Life in Palestine" after a visit to that land. Dr.
Griggs gave a course on "Social Progress." Distinguished
visitors from the old country were
Sir William Ramsay, the highest authority in the
English-speaking world on the church in the New
Testament age, and Lady Ramsay. Both
lectured, Lady Ramsay on "The Women of Turkey."
Mrs. Philip Snowden gave another course<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
of lectures, maintaining fully her popularity.
She was strongly in favor of the suffrage for women
but as strongly opposed to the methods of the militant
suffragettes. Another speaker who attracted
attention, although his views were not accepted by
the majority at Chautauqua, was the Secretary of
the American Federation of Labor, Mr. John B.
Lennon. On the questions pertaining to trade
unions and collective bargaining, however, one who
talked with the Chautauqua constituency was
surprised to find so large a number of progressive
thinkers taking the side of labor against capital.</p>

<p>The Chautauqua Devotional Hour was represented
in the season of 1910 by Dr. Hugh
Black, Dr. J. Wilbur Chapman, Dr. G. A. Johnston
Ross, and Charles D. Williams, who was now
Bishop of Michigan.</p>

<p>It has been found that many are eager to enjoy
the advantages of the Summer Schools at Chautauqua
who are unable to meet the expense.
To aid these, various gifts have been made from
time to time. On old First Night in 1910 a system
of fifty annual scholarships was established by
setting apart the offering of that evening for this
purpose, and the fund has since been increased
from year to year.</p>

<p>In 1911, the Miller Bell Tower at the Point<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
beside the Pier was dedicated. For years the
chime of Meneely bells had stood in the belfry of
the old building on the Pier. But the piles
beneath it were becoming decayed and the bells
by their weight and their movement racked the old
edifice. Their removal was necessary and the
Tower was built adjoining the wharf. A fine clock
presented by the Seth Thomas Clock Company,
and the chimes, were placed in the summit of the
Tower which received the name "Lewis Miller Bell
Tower." These bells ring five minutes before the
lecture hours, and at certain times, morning,
noon, and night, the chimes play familiar music.
After the night bell, which may be either at 10 or
10.30, silence is supposed to reign throughout the
grounds. One of the original peal of four bells,
afterward enlarged to form the chime of ten bells,
is named the Bryant bell, and is rung precisely
at twelve o'clock noon on the first day of October
as a signal for beginning the readings of the Chautauqua
Circle. The name is in honor of William
Cullen Bryant, in recognition of his interest in
the C. L. S. C.</p>

<p>During the season of 1911 a number of illustrated
lectures were given by Prof. R. W. Moore
on "The Rhine"; by C. L. Harrington on "Aerial
Navigation,"&mdash;a lecture fully up to date at that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
time, surprising to many who heard it and looked
at the pictures. But that was before the great
war, and the same lecture would be hopelessly
behind the times in 1921. Mr. Henry Turner
Bailey showed us "A Dozen Masterpieces of
Painting," and Mr. Jacob A. Riis, "The Making of
an American," Dr. Henry R. Rose exhibited
"The Oberammergau Passion Play," and Dr. H.
H. Powers, "Venice." Both President George E.
Vincent and Director Arthur E. Bestor gave
lectures; also Edmund Vance Cooke and Mr.
Earl Barnes, Mr. Leland Powers impersonated
stories and plays as nobody else could. Mr.
Frank A. Vanderlip gave three lectures on "Banking,"
which proved far more interesting than
most of us had anticipated. Dr. H. H. Powers
told in a series of lectures the stories of five great
cities, Athens, Rome, Florence, Paris, and London.
Dr. Gunsaulus gave a series of lectures on "Some
of the Great Plays of Shakespeare"; Prof. S. C.
Schmucker, a series mingling science with history
on "American Students of Nature,&mdash;Audubon,
Agassiz, Gray and Thoreau." Dean George
Hodges in the Department of Religion lectured
in a course on "Christian Social Betterment."</p>

<p>Among the chaplains of 1911 are the names of
Bishop E. E. Hoss of the Methodist Episcopal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
Church, South, Dr. John T. Stone of Chicago, Dr.
Shailer Mathews, also of Chicago, Dr. C. F. Aked,
then a pastor in San Francisco, and Rev. Silvester
Horne of England. The baccalaureate sermon
before the C. L. S. C. was this year given by the
Chancellor, Bishop Vincent.</p>

<p>For twenty-two years William H. Sherwood was
head of the piano department in the schools and
untiring in his labors. He died in 1910, and in
1912 the Sherwood Memorial Studio on College
Hill was opened and dedicated to his memory.
A hospital, long needed, was this year established,
named "The Lodge." The Department of Religious
Work was reorganized, made more prominent,
and placed under the charge of Dean Shailer
Mathews as "Director of Religious Work." The
headquarters of this department were established
in the Hall of Christ.</p>

<p>The Independence Day address was given by
Director Bestor on "The Old World and the New,"
the social, political, municipal, religious conception
on the two sides of the Atlantic. Two stories from
his lectures are worthy of being repeated. One
was Theodore Roosevelt's retort when accused
of wanting to become a king. "A king! what is a
king? Why, a kind of perpetual Vice-President."
The other was a conversation that Mr. Bestor had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
with an Englishman whom he met in Berlin. He
asked "What would you do in England if the royal
line should develop a William II. or a Roosevelt?"
The Englishman answered, "Impossible! A man
with any real political initiative is not to be
thought of in the English kingship!"</p>

<p>For the first time, partisan political addresses
were given on the Chautauqua platform. This
was the year, it will be remembered, when Mr.
Taft had been renominated by the regular Republican
Convention, Mr. Roosevelt by the bolting
Progressives, and Woodrow Wilson by the
Democrats. It was decided to allow each of the
parties to be represented. Attorney-General
Wickersham spoke in behalf of the Republicans.
Mr. Eugene W. Chafin, the candidate of the
Prohibition Party, addressed a crowded Amphitheater,
and seemed to give everybody great
enjoyment from the constant laughter and applause.
He said after the election that if everybody
who applauded and cheered his speeches had
voted for him, he would have been President!</p>

<p>But the great audience assembled, packing the
Amphitheater to its utmost corner, with a great
ring of people standing around it, to hear William
Jennings Bryan. On account of an afternoon
lecture in Ohio, he sent word that he could not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
arrive until 8.45 in the evening, and it was nine
when at last he stood on the platform. But he
held the crowd in rapt attention to the end of his
plea in behalf of the Democratic Party and its
candidate, who was indebted to Mr. Bryan more
than to any other worker for his nomination and,
as the result showed, for his election. I am not
certain who spoke in behalf of Mr. Roosevelt, but
think that it was Mr. William H. Prendergast,
Comptroller of New York City.</p>

<p>Among the lecturers of 1912 we heard the
Baroness Von Suttner, who had taken the Nobel
Peace Prize by her book <i>Lay Down Your Arms</i>. She
gave a strong plea for arbitration between nations,
to take the place of war. There was also a lecture
by David Starr Jordan, President of Leland
Stanford University, on "The Case Against War,"
showing conclusively that the day of wars was past
and that the financial interrelations of nations
would make a great war impossible. How little
we dreamed of the war-cloud within two years to
drench the whole world in blood! There was,
indeed, one warning voice at this Assembly, that of
Mr. H. H. Powers, in his clear-sighted lecture on
"International Problems in Europe." He did not
predict war, but he showed from what causes
a great war might arise. There was a debate on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
Woman Suffrage. Mrs. Ida Husted Harper gave
several lectures in its behalf, and Miss Alice Hill
Chittenden on "The Case Against Suffrage."
Professor Scott Nearing gave a course of lectures
on social questions, showing powerfully the evils
of the time, and setting forth his view of the
remedy,&mdash;a socialistic reorganization of the State
and of society in general. Some conservative
people who heard Scott Nearing lecture, regarded
him as a firebrand, in danger of burning up the
national temple, but those who met him in social
life were compelled to yield to the charm of his
personal attractiveness. Dr. Leon H. Vincent
gave a course of lectures on "Contemporary English
Novelists." He began in the Hall of Philosophy,
but was compelled to move into the
Amphitheater. Mr. Charles D. Coburn of the
Coburn Players gave a careful, critical address,
summing up fairly the good and evil, on "The
Drama and the Present Day Theater."</p>

<p>The Daily Devotional Service in the Amphitheater,
and the addresses on "The Awakened
Church," in the Hall of Christ, one at nine o'clock,
the other at ten, drew large congregations. It
could not be said that Chautauqua was losing
interest in religion, Canon H. J. Cody of Toronto
gave a series of talks on "Bible Portraits<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
of Persons we Know: 1, The Average Man; 2, The
Man in the Street; 3, The Man who Misapplies the
Past; 4, The Man who is Dying of Things"; Prof.
Francis S. Peabody of Harvard a series on "Christian
Life in the Modern World." Bishop
McDowell (Methodist) conducted the Hour for a
week to the great spiritual uplift of the large audience.
Dr. Shailer Mathews gave an interesting
series on "The Conversations of Jesus," Dr.
James A. Francis a course on "Evangelism."</p>

<p>Realizing how many worthy names I have
omitted, I close regretfully the record of Chautauqua
in 1912.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>

<h3>WAR CLOUDS AND WAR DRUMS<br />(1913-1916)</h3>




<p><span class="smcap">There</span> have been visitors at Chautauqua who,
listening to some of the lecturers and their radical
expressions, were alarmed and inclined to believe
that the woods were full of cranks, faultfinders of
the general social order, wild agitators, and revolutionary
reformers bent on reorganizing the
world. Chautauqua has always favored the freest
discussion of all subjects and has admitted to its
platform spokesmen upon all the questions of the
time and from every point of view, even some
unpopular men airing their unpopular ideas,
confident that in the conflict of opinions the right
will triumph. In 1913 the living question under
discussion was Socialism; what it means, its positive
aims and the arguments both for and against
it. Here are the names of some speakers on that
controverted subject. Professor Scott Nearing,
perhaps the most radical of any, spoke on "Social
Sanity," although his conception of sanity was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
looked upon by many as absolutely insane. Mr.
J. W. Bengough explained and advocated "The
Single Tax" and almost converted some of us to
his doctrine. Mrs. Rose Pastor Stokes, a most
winsome speaker, without opinion as to her views,
told us of "The Socialist's Attitude towards
Charity," which was that much denominated
charity is simple justice. Mr. Victor L. Berger
of Milwaukee, who has several times been denied a
seat in Congress to which he was elected on the
Socialist ticket, stated the views and demands of
his party. Dr. H. H. Powers spoke on "Present
Day Socialism in Europe," John Mitchell gave us
"The Trades-union Point of View." Earl Barnes
took part in the discussion, and Dr. Charles R.
Henderson of Chicago also touched upon it.
Some speakers were openly for, others as strongly
against the movement. Whether the Socialist
Party gained voters may be doubted, but it
certainly enjoyed a full and fair hearing.</p>

<p>Turning from politics to religion, which should
have a more intimate friendship than most people
give them, we notice the Devotional Hour during
the season of 1913. The Chaplain for the first
week was Dr. Charles F. Wishart of the Pittsburgh
Theological Seminary, his addresses being on "The
Christian View of Some Facts of Life." Dr. Lynn<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
Harold Hough, then a Methodist pastor in Baltimore,
and Rev. Arthur C. Hill of London were on
the list. Dr. S. M. Crothers of Cambridge, Mass.,
preached one Sunday and conducted the Devotional
Hour a week in a series on "Gaining the
Mastery." Bishop Williams was on the platform
again, speaking on "Aspects of Personal Religion."
Anyone who attended this service through the
season&mdash;and the daily congregation was not far
below a thousand&mdash;would obtain a pretty clear
understanding of Christianity and the character
of its advocates.</p>

<p>Every year the musical element grows at Chautauqua.
There was this year, as had been the case
for several seasons, a Musical Festival Week, with
daily concerts. For many years there had been
a quartette of the best soloists during July and
another during August, supported by a chorus
often of three hundred voices and the great
Massey organ. Henry B. Vincent, who is the son
of Dr. B. T. Vincent of the Children's Class, grew
up at Chautauqua, in a sense, spending his summers
there from early childhood. For many years he
has been at the organ seat, except when conducting
the orchestra which he organized and trained.
In 1912 he gave an interesting course of lectures
on "How to Listen to Music." Every Sunday<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
afternoon a large audience assembles to hear Mr.
Vincent for an hour in an organ recital. An
oratorio of his composition and under his direction
was given at Chautauqua some years ago, entitled
"The Prodigal Son." With one Vincent Founder
and Chancellor, his son the President, one nephew
a lecturer every year or two on literature, the other
nephew the organ and band master, and his mother
the President of the Woman's Club for many years,
the Vincent family has been worthily represented
at Chautauqua.</p>

<p>While speaking of music we must not forget one
course of lectures by Mr. Olin Downes, musical
critic of the <i>Boston Post</i>, on "Musical Expression
in Dramatic Form," a history of the music drama
in general; early French operas; the German
Romantic School; Richard Wagner; Verdi and
Latter-day Italians.</p>

<p>Prof. Richard Burton gave an entire course of
lectures on "The Serious Bernard Shaw," which
caused a run upon the library for Shaw's writings,
as I perceived, for I vainly sought them. Miss
Maud Miner of the School of Expression gave
some recitals and a lecture, packed full of suggestions
on "Efficiency in Speech." Dr. George
Vincent spoke to a crowded Amphitheater on "A
National Philosophy of Life." A Serbian, Prince<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
Lazarovich Hvebelianovich, gave a lurid picture
of the Balkan situation. Let me quote one
sentence as reported in the Daily of July 11, 1913
(note the date):</p>

<p>"Within the next few months there will be a
war; and such a war as has not stirred Europe since
the days of Napoleon; a war that will involve all
the principal nations on that side of the Atlantic."</p>

<p>Less than thirteen months after that prediction
came the event in the capital of his own little
nation which let loose twenty millions of armed
men, filled the seas with warships, above and beneath
the waves, and the skies with fighting
aeroplanes.</p>

<p>Mrs. Percy V. Pennybacker of Texas, gave a
series of addresses on the Federation of Woman's
Clubs, of which she was at that time the
President. We listened to a Chinaman, Ng Poon
Chew, the editor of a Chinese daily paper in San
Francisco, on "China in Transformation," a clear
account of the new Republic of China in its varied
aspects, spoken in the best of English. We
noticed too, that the speaker showed an understanding
and appreciation which foreigners are
often slow to obtain of American humor and
jokes.</p>

<p>Another lecturer from abroad, though hardly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
a foreigner, for he came from England, Prof. J.
Stoughton Holborn, wearing his Oxford gown
(which we had not seen before at Chautauqua),
gave a course on "The Inspiration of Greece,"&mdash;a
view of that wonderful people in the different
fields of their greatness. Think of one city which
in the departments of literature, drama, philosophy,
oratory, art, and public affairs could show
more great men in two hundred years than all the
rest of the world could show in two thousand!</p>

<p>We were treated during the season of 1913 to a
sight new at that time, though common enough
now. Mr. Engels brought to Chautauqua a
Curtiss hydroplane, and day after day made
flights, skimming over the surface of the lake,
rising into the air, circling the sky and returning
to the starting-point, to the amazement of the
watching multitudes. A few, and but a few, dared
to be strapped into the machine and take the
flight; Director Bestor was one of them, and when
Mrs. Bestor heard of it she said: "I told him that
he must not do it, but I knew all the time that he
would!"</p>

<p>Another event of the season was the production
of a Greek play, in the original language, by a
group of college students in Greek costume.
Another fact worthy of remembrance was the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
opening of a completely furnished playground for
the children in the ravine near the ball-ground.
To stand on the bridge and look down upon that
company of happy little people, is always a delight.
Also it is not to be forgotten that this year for
the first time natural gas for cooking and heating
was supplied throughout the grounds.</p>

<p>The year 1914 was the fortieth anniversary of
the founding of Chautauqua. One of the Founders
was with us, hale and hearty, and still able to
give an admirable address, although his memory of
recent matters and people had failed. The other
Founder was no longer among us, and even fifteen
years after his departure we of the earlier days
missed him; but his memory will ever be kept
green at Chautauqua, while the white lilies are
silently unfolded in his honor. On Friday, July
3d, the signal fires were lighted all around the
Lake. The celebration of the anniversary did not
take place until August, near the date in the month
of the first Assembly. On Sunday, August 2d,
Bishop Vincent preached in the Amphitheater with
scarcely any lessening of his old power. At the
anniversary service, Dr. Jesse L. Hurlbut&mdash;who
was exhibited as one of the survivals of the prehistoric
age, a sort of a dinosaurus or pleiosaurus,&mdash;gave
an address on "Memories of Early Days,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
of which the reader may find the substance scattered
through these pages. But we must give a
paragraph or two from Mrs. Frank Beard's paper.</p>

<p>In reference to the interdenominational aspect of
the Assembly, she said:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The good Baptist brother, wandering down by the
Dead Sea and Sea of Galilee to the Mediterranean,
looked at the generous supply of water and was
satisfied. The Presbyterian brother gazed into the
cloudless sky above him, saw his favorite color, and
felt that Chautauqua was foreordained for him. The
lineal descendant of St. Peter croqueted his ball
through the arch and rejoiced that he was on saving
ground.</p>

<p>We sat on the hard board seats with nothing to
rest our backs upon but the salubrious atmosphere.
We heard ponderous speakers who talked on ponderous
subjects. Among the speakers was Joseph
Cook, also Bishop Peck, 350 pounds. Some of the
lecturers were recommended as cultured and highly
finished. Mr. Beard said that he had attended these
lectures, was glad that they were cultured and more
than pleased that they were finished.</p></div>

<p>The music week had now become a permanent
institution, bringing thousands to the Assembly.
This year it began on Monday, July 27th, with
Victor Herbert's orchestra through the seven days,
the Chautauqua soloists, and the great chorus
trained by Alfred Hallam. Some musical associations<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
from Jamestown and elsewhere added their
voices.</p>

<p>Among the lecturers, Mr. Griggs gave a course
on "Dramas of Protest," the Book of Job, Shelley's
"Prometheus Unbound," Galsworthy's "Justice,"
Calderon's "Life is a Dream," and some others.
Bourke Cockran, the brilliant orator of Irish descent,
gave a great lecture on "Abraham Lincoln&mdash;Original
Progressive." Miss Mary E. Downey,
Director of the Library School, spoke on "The
Evolution of the Library," Dean Edwin Watts
Chubb on "Shakespeare as a Moral Teacher."
John Purroy Mitchel, the reform Mayor of New
York, spoke on "Municipal Government" on
July 18th; Dr. Lincoln Hulley of Florida gave a
course on the leading American poets. Mr. E. H.
Blichfeldt spoke most interestingly on "Mexico
as I Know It," the results of a year of wide travel
and close observation in that land.</p>

<p>During the month of July we read in the papers
of complications in the political world beyond
the ocean, but few looked for serious trouble and
none for actual war. On the first of August, 1914,
the storm burst, and nation after nation in a few
hours assembled their hosts for the most terrible
war in the history of the world. In accordance
with the Chautauqua tradition of free and open<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
discussion, a War Symposium was improvised and
each of the contending nations had its speaker.
On Tuesday, August 4th, Dr. Hans E. Gronow
who had served his time in the German army gave
"The German Point of View." On Thursday,
August 6th, Mr. Sanford Griffith, a newspaper
correspondent and a student of public affairs
spending several years in Europe whom some of us
had known as a boy at Chautauqua, spoke on
"European Unrest Due to Shifts in the Balance of
Power." On Friday, August 7th, Mons. Benedict
Papot, formerly a soldier in France, gave "The
French Point of View," and on Saturday, August
9th, Dr. W. S. Bainbridge, English in ancestry
but American in birth and spirit, presented "The
British Point of View." All the exercises of the
crowded program were held, but amid all our
efforts the war brooded above us, a darkening
cloud.</p>

<p>The Department of Religious Work was carried
on with a strong force of speakers and teachers
under the direction of Dr. Shailer Mathews, its
details supervised by his efficient assistant, Miss
Georgia L. Chamberlin of Chicago, who also
gave daily lectures. Among the instructors were
Dr. Charles F. Kent of Yale, and Dr. James Hope
Moulton, one of the richest minds of the age in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
Biblical lore, who gave a series of lectures, learned
yet simple, on "The Origins of Religion." None
of us could have thought then that this noble life
in its prime was destined to end in the Mediterranean
by a shot from a German submarine.</p>

<p>The Devotional Hour and the Sunday services
were led for a week by the Rev. C. Rexford Raymond
of Brooklyn, who told in several chapters the
old story of Joseph, yet seeming new in its application.
The Rev. G. Robinson Lees, Vicar of St.
Andrews, Lambeth, England, who had lived in
Palestine and among the Arabs in the desert, had
written a book forbidden by the Turkish authorities,
and had been banished from the land,
preached one Sunday morning and gave graphic
pictures of Oriental life through the week. Dr.
W. H. Hickman, a former President of the Chautauqua
Board of Trustees, Rev. Peter Ainslie of
Baltimore, Dr. C. F. Wishart, Dr. Washington
Gladden, one who was ever welcome at Chautauqua;
and a great-hearted man, Dr. George W. Truett
of Texas, were also chaplains, each serving a week.</p>

<p>This year also the new golf course was opened
on the field beyond the public highway, to the
rejoicing of many patrons. At the close of
the season the annual convention was held by
the International Lyceum and Chautauqua Association,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
the union of bureaus and speakers in the
"Chain Chautauquas" held all over the continent,
of which we shall speak later. Their meetings
were continued until September 10th, making
1914 the longest session in the history of
Chautauqua.</p>

<p>In 1915, the war of the world was bringing its
unspeakable terrors to Europe, and America was
looking on, yet hesitating to plunge into the welter;
but Chautauqua held on its even way, its courses
of instruction as many, and its classes as large as
ever. This year Dr. George E. Vincent felt
constrained by the pressure of his duties as President
of the University of Minnesota, with its eight
thousand students and as large a number in its
University Extension courses, to withdraw from
the direct supervision of Chautauqua. He resigned
his office as President of the Chautauqua
Institution, and Dr. Arthur E. Bestor became
President. But Dr. Vincent retained his membership
on the Board of Trustees, was named Honorary
President, and has continued to come to
Chautauqua almost every year. Even for a few
days, and with a lecture or two, his presence gives
strength to the Assembly.</p>

<p>In 1917, Dr. Vincent resigned the presidency
of the University of Minnesota to accept the same<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
position with the Rockefeller Foundation, disbursing
millions of dollars every year in the interests of
world-wide education and health.</p>

<p>The lecture platform of 1915 was arranged under
six great weeks, each making prominent one subject,
while popular addresses and the devotional
services went on parallel with them all. The
first week was devoted to the study of community
service. Mary Antin, whose book, <i>The Promised
Land</i>, had been read by everybody, was greeted by
an audience far beyond the reach of her voice,
speaking in her ardent manner. Dr. Lincoln
Wirt proclaimed "America's Challenge to the
World"; Mr. E. J. Ward explained the why and
the how of "Community Service," and Norman
Angell set forth "American Leadership in World
Politics." During this week Chancellor McCormick
of the University of Pittsburgh conducted
the services of the Devotional Hour.</p>

<p>The second week was devoted to the Drink
Problem. Bishop Francis J. McConnell of the
Methodist Episcopal Church preached on Sunday
morning and spoke at the Devotional Hour each
day. The opening address was by Governor
George A. Carlson of Colorado, who set forth
powerfully the methods and results of prohibition
in his State. Dr. H. A. Gibbons spoke on "The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
Prohibition Question in Europe." The Hon. J.
Denny O'Neill, on "Booze and Politics." While
the temperance question was discussed in the Hall
of Philosophy, there were concerts and lectures in
the Amphitheater, one especially by Mr. Sanford
Griffith, who had been at the battle front as a war
correspondent, on "Fighting in Flanders." Also Dr.
Hamilton Wright Mabie, editor and essayist, spoke
on "The East and West, Friends or Enemies?"</p>

<p>The third week was entitled "Justice and the
Courts"&mdash;with such subjects as law, legislation,
the administration of justice, and penology.
Among the speakers were George W. Alger,
Thomas Mott Osborne, Katharine Bement Davis,
Judge W. L. Ransom of New York, and Dean
James Parker Hall of the University of Chicago
Law School. Mr. Charles Rann Kennedy, author
of <i>The Servant in the House</i>, a drama with a sermon,
recited the play, aided by Mrs. Kennedy. The
play had already been read a year or two before by
Mrs. Bertha Kunz Baker, and also enacted by the
Chautauqua Players, so that we were familiar with
it, but were eager to hear it recited by its author.
Mr. Kennedy also gave some dramatic interpretations
from the Bible. This week the Devotional
Hour was held by Dr. Charles W. Gilkey, of the
Hyde Park Baptist Church in Chicago, the church<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
nearest to the University and attended by many of
the faculty and students.</p>

<p>The music week was notable from the presence
of the Russian Symphony Orchestra, led by a
great player and delightful personality, Modest
Altschuler. One of his company said of him,
"He rules his orchestra by love." The Recognition
Address this year was by President E. B.
Bryan of Colgate University, on the all-important
question: "Who are Good Citizens?"</p>

<p>The forty-third Assembly in 1916 found our
country in the throes of a presidential election,
party strife bitter, and the nation divided on the
impending question of our entrance into the world
war. The feverish pulse of the time was manifested
in the opinions expressed by the different
speakers. Dr. George E. Vincent gave a lecture
on "What is Americanism"&mdash;a sane, thoughtful
view which was needed in that hour.</p>

<p>The week beginning Sunday, July 23d, was
devoted to the subject of Preparedness for War or
Peace. The Ford Peace Expedition of that year
will be remembered, the effort of a wealthy manufacturer
to stop the war. Several who had taken
part in that apparently quixotic movement spoke
in defense or criticism of it, and also the question
of preparedness was discussed by Governor Charles<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
S. Whitman, President Hibben of Princeton, Hon.
Henry A. Wise Wood, Senator W. M. Calder,
and others. Mrs. Lucia Ames Ward, of the
Woman's Peace Party, was opposed to any
participation in the war or preparation for it.
The controversy waxed warm, for the opinions
were positive on both sides.</p>

<p>On subjects aside from the war we had an
enlightening series of addresses at the Devotional
Hour by Dean Charles R. Brown of Yale; a course
of lectures by Dr. Edwin E. Slosson on "Major
Prophets of To-day," Bernard Shaw, G. K.
Chesterton, H. G. Wells, and some others; a series
of lectures by Dr. Percy F. Boynton on "The
Growth of Consciousness in American Literature,"&mdash;as
shown in Irving, Cooper, Emerson, Lowell,
and Whitman. Raymond Robins gave four lectures
on "The Church and the Laboring Classes."
Dr. Griggs awakened general interest by his lectures
on "Types of Men and Women," as illustrated
in their autobiographies and letters, presenting
John Stuart Mill, Benevenuto Cellini, George
John Romanes, Marie Bashkirtseff, Sonya Kovalevasky
(a new name to most of us), and Henri
Frederic Amiel,&mdash;all possessing characters pronounced,
some of them so peculiar as to be almost
abnormal.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span></p>

<p>The Russian Symphony Orchestra, with its
beloved director, Modest Altschuler, was with us
again for another week, aided by the soloists and
Chautauqua Chorus. In our rapid survey, we
have only glanced at the prominent events in a
great season.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>

<h3>WAR AND ITS AFTERMATH<br />(1917-1920)</h3>




<p><span class="smcap">When</span> the forty-fourth session of Chautauqua
opened on Thursday, June 26, 1917, it found the
American republic just entering upon the Great
War, which had already raged in Europe for over
two years. Training camps had sprung up like magic
all over the land, from ocean to ocean, and young
men by the hundred thousand had volunteered,
with others by the million soon cheerfully to accept
drafting orders. Almost every university had
been transformed into a war college. President
Vincent was at the intensive military training
school at Plattsburg, N. Y. Every morning before
breakfast two hundred men at Chautauqua were
marching and counter-marching, and learning the
manual of arms with wooden guns, with President
Bestor and most of the officials of the Institution
in the lines. The young women every afternoon
were receiving similar drill under a woman officer,
and some said that they presented even a more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
soldier-like appearance than the men. The headquarters
of several denominations had been commandeered
for Red Cross work and training. A
stranger could scarcely get into the Methodist
House without being scrutinized as a possible
German spy, with a pocketful of poison or powdered
glass to sprinkle on the bandages. War was
in the air as well as in the newspapers. No matter
what was the subject of a lecture it was almost sure
to be on the war before the finish. There were
discussions on the platform and on the street about
the League of Nations, some with President Wilson
in favor of it, others as vigorously against it. A
symposium on "Our Country" and a conference of
"Organizations Engaged in Education for Patriotic
Service" were held during the session; also a
company of students from the Carnegie Institute
of Technology, Pittsburgh, presented a brilliant
pageant, "The Drawing of the Sword."</p>

<p>The Fourth of July address was given by the
Hon. G. W. Wickersham, former Attorney-General
of the United States. Captain A. Radclyffe Dugmore
of the British Army spoke on "Our Fight
for Freedom." Miss Ida Tarbell, who had won
fame by a book showing the operations of the
Standard Oil Company, and had also written a
life of Abraham Lincoln, to be found in every<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
public library and read more widely than any other
biography of the Greatest American, gave some
lectures. Her literary life, by the way, began
in the office of the <i>Chautauquan Magazine</i>. Mrs.
Percy V. Pennybacker this summer became President
of the Chautauqua Woman's Club, which
office Mrs. B. T. Vincent had relinquished after
many years of leadership. Both these presidents
were eminently successful in different directions
and by different methods, the earlier having built
up the Club by wisdom mingled with gentleness;
her successor carried it onward by an energy
that brought everybody into willing subjection to
her far-reaching plans. Almost the first result of
the new administration was the purchase of a club
house fronting on the Lake, and holding in it
almost a bewildering series of teas and receptions.
While the public meetings of the Club crowded
the new Hall of Philosophy every afternoon, Mrs.
Pennybacker gave a stirring address on "What our
Country Asks of its Young Women."</p>

<p>During the first week Dr. Harry Emerson Fosdick
of the Union Theological Seminary was the
Chaplain, and his addresses blended fervent
patriotism and fervent religion in about equal
measure.</p>

<p>The second week, from July 8th to 14th, was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
denominated "Arts and Letters," with lectures
on these subjects by Dr. Mitchell Carroll of Washington,
Henry Turner Bailey of Boston, and others.
But underneath the artistic and the literary, the
echo of the war might still be heard in many of the
lectures, and it sounded out in the Devotional
Hour addresses of that soldier in the army of the
Lord, the Chaplain, Bishop Charles D. Williams.</p>

<p>During the week of July 15th to 21st, the Methodist
Bishop, William Burt of Buffalo, to whose
"area" (for Methodists of course could not call it a
"diocese") Chautauqua belongs, was the Chaplain.
During this week we heard lectures by Admiral
Peary, the discoverer of the North Pole; by
Thomas Adams of Canada; by D. R. Garland of
Ohio; by D. A. Reed of Michigan, and by George
A. Bellamy of Cleveland.</p>

<p>July 22d-28th was Musical Festival Week,
when we had with us once more the Russian
Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Modest Altschuler,
who was welcomed with sincere rejoicing
by Chautauqua's multitude. Looking over the
crowded Amphitheater during those daily concerts,
the only reminder of a war in progress was
that scarcely a young man was to be seen, although
every seat was occupied.</p>

<p>From July 29th to August 4th, the Great War<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
was the theme on the platform. Mr. Earl Barnes
gave a series of lectures on "Historical Backgrounds
of the War," respectively in the British
Empire, France, Germany, Austro-Hungary, the
Russian Empire, and the Balkan Peninsular. Dr.
Herbert Adams Gibbons presented some of the
"Problems of the Peace Conference,"&mdash;though at
that time nobody knew when the Conference
would be held or whether anybody would be left
alive to hold it. But the cheerful assumption
was taken that Germany would be beaten, which
proved to be correct, and also that the Allies
would rearrange the map of the world, which does
not now appear to be quite certain. Mr. Sanford
Griffith, just from the front, gave us an inspiring
word-picture of "Paris Reborn."</p>

<p>The concluding address of the symposium was
given by President Bestor on "America and the
War." It was considered by the National Security
League as of sufficient value to be published in
pamphlet form, and received a wide circulation.</p>

<p>From August 13th to 18th, Bishop Charles B.
Mitchell (Methodist Episcopal), living at Minneapolis,
held the post of Chaplain, and gave a
number of heart warming addresses on "The Transforming
Power of Divine Grace." During the
week the Recognition Day exercises were held,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
with all pomp and ceremonial, the address being
given by President George E. Vincent. His father
was present and that afternoon, as Chancellor,
gave the diplomas to the graduates, but none of us
knew that it was for the last time, and that his
face would not be seen again at Chautauqua, although
he lived nearly three years longer.</p>

<p>In 1917, President E. B. Bryan of Colgate
University accepted the position as Director of the
Summer Schools. But to one who through the
rest of the year has a college full of students to
keep in order, and also a faculty to maintain in
harmony&mdash;which one college president told me he
found the harder task,&mdash;the burden at Chautauqua
of a hundred and twenty-five teachers,
two hundred courses of study, and forty-five
hundred students during nearly all his summer
vacation, proved too heavy even for Dr. Bryan's
shoulders, and after three years, in 1919, he was
compelled to relinquish it into the hands of
President Bestor.</p>

<p>This summer, also, the new traction station of
the Chautauqua Lake Railway was opened at
the highway entrance to the grounds; a handsome
pillared structure with more room than Chautauqua
had ever before possessed for waiting
room, ticket office, baggage, freight, and express, a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
convenience appreciated by every visitor. Also,
by the shore a new bathhouse and the Jacob
Bolin Gymnasium were built and opened, as well
as the Fenton Memorial Home for Methodist
Deaconesses on the Overlook addition.</p>

<p>In 1918, we were in the grip of the war, with our
young men in camp by the million, overseas and
on their way by the hundred thousand, and every
woman "doing her bit" in the Red Cross work.
Outwardly, Chautauqua seemed as flourishing as
in other years, the hotels and cottages appeared to
be full, the Amphitheater was crowded at the concerts
and popular lectures, and the main streets before
and after lectures were a continuous procession.
But the gate receipts showed that the Institution,
in common with every college in the land, was
lessened in its attendance and its financial returns.
Nevertheless, the program was not allowed to
decline in its extent and its interest. Indeed,
one added feature attracted attention. In the
field of the Overlook a National Service School
was held in cooperation with the Woman's Naval
Service. A tented camp was maintained under
the strict discipline of Mrs. George E. Vincent,
with regular guards, and training for more
than two hundred khaki-clad young women in
agriculture, telegraphy, basketry, and canteen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
management. I am not sure about carpentry,
though I saw a photograph of young women sawing
boards and putting up a house.</p>

<p>The value of Chautauqua in national patriotic
leadership was recognized, not only by our own
government, but by the Allies as well. Great
Britain, France, Belgium, Italy, and Greece sent
official speakers, either through their embassies or
their special war missions. It was a mark of
distinguished favor that the French High Commission
gave the French Military Band to Chautauqua
for a week, their longest engagement in
this country.</p>

<p>On the opening day, July 4th, President Bestor
gave the oration on "Mobilizing the Mind of
America." For nearly a year before, and until
the Armistice in November of this year, Mr.
Bestor was almost without intermission in Washington
in government service as head of the
Department of Publicity. He was Director of the
Speaking Division of the Committee on Public
Information, and also Secretary of the Committee
on Patriotism of the National Security League,
an organization which held in many places training
camps for patriotic speakers. Dr. Bestor was
carrying on more than double duty until the
Armistice in 1918 gave him something of a breathing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
spell between the sessions of Chautauqua.
During the week from July 7th to 13th, Bishop
Edwin H. Hughes (Methodist Episcopal) was
Chaplain, and gave addresses of a high character
on "Varieties of Religious Experience." As
samples of the type of lectures during this strenuous
battle summer, this week President E. B.
Bryan spoke on "War as a Schoolmaster," Mr.
E. H. Griggs began a course on "The War and the
Reconstruction of Democracy," and Dr. L. A.
Weigle of Yale lectured on "Religious Education
in War Times." One evening Dr. S. H. Clark
read war lyrics in the Amphitheater.</p>

<p>The week from July 14th to 20th was "Women's
Service Week," and among those who spoke on the
subject were Anna Howard Shaw, who had been
called by the President to be Chairman of the
Women's National Council of Defense, in command
of all the activities of women in aid of the
war, Miss Helen Fraser of England, Mrs. Carrie
Chapman Catt, Mrs. Ella A. Boole, Mrs. Pennybacker,
and Mrs. George Thatcher Guernsey,&mdash;women
whose voices had often been heard in
behalf of woman suffrage, now as ardently speaking
in aid of work to carry on the war. This
week Dr. S. P. Cadman had been engaged as
Chaplain, but he was unable to remain more than<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
one day and other men were suddenly drafted
to take his place on successive mornings, one of
them, the writer of these pages, on fifteen minutes'
notice called to conduct the Devotional Hour,
immediately after an hour's teaching in class.
This little incident, of no particular interest
to anybody but the writer, is mentioned merely
to illustrate the instant change of front which
must be made frequently at Chautauqua, when a
speaker is delayed by a railroad wreck or unexpectedly
called home to conduct a funeral.</p>

<p>"Our Allies" was the title of the week from July
22d to 27th. Dr. Charles W. Gilkey of Chicago
preached the sermon on Sunday morning and led
in the devotions through the week. Prof. Robert
Herndon Fife of the Wesleyan University, Conn.,
gave a series of lectures on "The New Europe."
Not all of his forecasts have yet come to pass,
for the new Europe is only slowly emerging out of
the old. Mrs. Kenneth Brown&mdash;the name sounds
American, but she is a Greek lady of rank, born
Demetra Vaka&mdash;told a harrowing tale of her own
experience and observation, "In the Heart of the
German Intrigue." Dr. Mitchell Carroll of Washington
gave an account of "Greece, our Youngest
Ally," with Venizelos as the hero. Lieut. Bruno
Roselli of the Italian army spoke; Miss Maud<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
Hayes of "England in War Time." On Friday
evening, July 26th, there was a concert in the
evening of national songs of the Allies; the flags
of more than twenty nations being hung above
the choir loft. On Grand Army Day in this week
Lieut. Telfair Marion Minton spoke on "The
Flags of a Thousand Years."</p>

<p>In the following week, July 28th to August 3d,
while the Musical Festival was in progress, the
French Military Band played every day, and
concert followed concert, with Gaul's "Joan of
Arc" sung one evening by the soloists and full
chorus. Dr. Leon H. Vincent gave a course of
lectures, showing "War in Literature," the stories
called forth by the Wars of Napoleon, the Crimean
War, the Franco-Prussian War of 1870, and the
struggle in progress in 1918&mdash;a most interesting
series. The Chaplain of this week was the Rev.
Wm. S. Jacobs, D.D., of Houston, Texas.</p>

<p>Omitting a fortnight for lack of room, we must
not omit "The Next Step Forward," the topic of
the week from August 18th to 24th, a discussion of
some movements to follow in the footsteps of war,
such as "Theological Reconstruction," by Shailer
Mathews; "Christianity in Foreign Lands," by
Dr. J. L. Barton, Secretary of the American Board
of Commissioners for Foreign Missions; "The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
Sunday Evening Club" and "Church Advertising,"
by W. F. McClure, and "The Art of Motion
Pictures," by Vachel Lindsay. There was also a
course on "Art in Daily Life," by our English
friend, Prof. I. B. Stoughton Holborn, of Oxford.</p>

<p>Bishop McConnell, who conducted the Devotional
Hour, August 11th-17th, also gave the
Recognition address to the graduating class of
the C. L. S. C., on "Ideals of Leadership." The
skies were clouded, yet we were able to hold the
procession as usual (only once in forty-seven years
has the march been broken up by rain), but the
storm fell during the address, with such noise
on the roof that the Bishop was compelled to pause
for some minutes until its rage abated. We
missed on this day especially the presence of
Bishop Vincent and his son, and the diplomas were
conferred by Dr. Bestor, the new President of
Chautauqua. Not long after the closing of the
Assembly, on November 11, 1918, "Armistice
Day" was ushered in by the blowing of every
steam whistle upon the continent, by all-day processions,
by bands and horns, and a surrender of
the nation to the universal joy, through the news
that the most terrible war that ever desolated the
world was over at last.</p>

<p>When the forty-sixth session of Chautauqua<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
opened in 1919, it found the land rejoicing over
the conclusion of the war, happy in the return of
two million men in khaki, apparently rich with
high wages, booming business, and money in
plenty. It was the top of a tide destined before
many months to recede to normal conditions.
But while the flush times lasted, Chautauqua
shared in the nation-wide prosperity. This was
the period of astounding financial drives. One
great church commemorated the hundred years of
its missionary enterprise by a centenary movement
and a subscription of more than a hundred
million dollars. Other churches followed with
"New Era" and "Nation Wide" campaigns. It
seemed to be the opportunity for Chautauqua to
reap some benefits from the spirit of the time, and
the trustees launched the "Comprehensive Plan"
to raise half a million dollars, freeing the Institution
from all debt and placing it on a safe,
permanent, and prosperous basis. Here was a
university of a hundred and twenty-five instructors,
two hundred courses of study, and nearly five
thousand students every summer, yet without a
dollar of endowment;&mdash;what college in the land
was doing so much with an income so small?
Here was a property of three hundred and fifty
acres, gradually accumulated, partly by the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
demands of the Institution's growth, partly from
the necessity of controlling its surroundings.
Debts had been incurred by enlargement of the
grounds, a sewer system, a water supply, electric
lighting, new buildings, new roads, and a hundred
items of improvement. The overhead expenses
of Chautauqua, in the form of interest that must
be paid, were more than thirty thousand dollars
every year. How much might be accomplished
if every debt could be cleared away and the saving
in interest be applied to the improvement of the
property and the enlargement of opportunities?
Mr. John D. Rockefeller made an offer of giving
one-fifth of all that should be raised, up to the
desired half-million dollars. The trustees assigned
to themselves another hundred thousand of the
amount, and a committee of the cottage owners
pledged $150,000 from those having property on
the ground. The plans were carefully laid, and
during the season of 1919 every visitor at Chautauqua
was called upon to make his contribution.</p>

<p>Of all the forty-six years of Chautauqua up to
1919, this was the most successful in its history.
The attendance shown by the receipts at the two
gates&mdash;one at the Pier where the steamboats
landed their thousands, the other at the new
station on the public highway where the trolley<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
brought the tens of thousands&mdash;were far beyond
that of any former year. The registration at the
schools was sixty-two per cent. in advance of 1918,
and eighteen per cent. beyond that of 1914, the
best previous year. Every hotel and boarding
house inside the fence was full, and pleas were
made to cottagers to open their doors to incoming
guests. Many who could not find lodging places
on the grounds found homes in the hotels and hamlets
around the Lake and came daily to the
Assembly by trolley or by boat.</p>

<p>During the opening week, Mr. W. W. Ellsworth
gave two illustrated lectures, one on "Theodore
Roosevelt," the other "The Rise and Fall of
Prussianism," and Prof. Thomas F. Moran of
Purdue University gave an appreciation of "Mark
Twain, Humorist, Reformer, and Philosopher."
Miss Maud Miner gave a popular recitation of
"Comedy Scenes from Shakespeare." It was
noticed that in the very opening the Amphitheater
was filled;&mdash;what would it become at the
height of the season, the first two weeks in August?</p>

<p>The Devotional Hour from July 6th to 12th
was held by Dr. Charles F. Wishart, in a series of
studies in the book of Exodus, entitled, "A Free
People in the Making," and from the story he
drew frequent applications to the history of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
another "free people." During this week, Dr.
Louis A. Weigle, Professor of Psychology at Yale
University, began a course of lectures on "Character
Building in the Public Schools" suggesting
many thoughts&mdash;not all of them gratulatory&mdash;in
those who heard them.</p>

<p>On Sunday morning, July 13th, the great
congregation heard Dr. Wm. P. Merrill, of the
Brick Church, New York, deliver a sermon on the
topic as announced, "The League of Nations," of
which he declared himself unreservedly in favor.
On this question there were two parties throughout
the nation strongly opposed to each other and
fiercely debating it, and when a fortnight later
the chaplain, Bishop Williams, who was never
known to sit on the fence, also came out vigorously
for the League, Mr. Bestor began to look
around for some speaker on the other side, for it
has been a principle at Chautauqua to give both
sides a fair showing, even when the Chautauqua
constituency as a whole might be opposed to a
speaker. A speaker against the League was found
in Mr. John Ferguson, but he evidently represented
the sentiments of the minority. Among
the speakers of the second week were several on
"The Aftermath of the Great War," among them
Dr. Katharine B. Davis, Major-General Bailey,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
who had been Commander of the Eighty-First
Division of the A. E. F., and Attorney-General
A. Mitchell Palmer. Prof. S. C. Schmucker also
gave a course of lectures on "The Races of Man."</p>

<p>Musical Festival Week was from July 28th
to August 2nd. The New York Symphony
Orchestra of sixty instruments was with us in
concerts daily, led in the absence of its conductor,
Mr. Walter Damrosch (who was abroad) by
Ren&eacute; Pollain of France. During this and the following
week Earl Barnes gave a course of lectures
on "The New Nations of the World." We
listened to a discussion of "Zionism," in a lecture
on "Jewish Aims in Palestine" by Charles A.
Cowen, of the Zionist organization, to which Mr.
Earl Barnes gave a cool, dispassionate answer,
showing the difficulty, amounting almost to an
impossibility, of establishing a Jewish State in the
land looked upon as holy, not only by Jews, but by
Mohammedans and Christians of all the great
churches. Another speaker in this symposium
was Mme. Mabel S. Grouetch, the wife of the
Serbian minister at Washington, who afterward
became the Czecho-Slovak representative to Japan.</p>

<p>Old First Night on August 5th was devoted to
the Comprehensive Plan of lifting Chautauqua
out of debt. The elements seemed against the aim<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
for rain kept some away,&mdash;though the Amphitheater
was full&mdash;and its thunder on the roof made
some speeches inaudible. But it could not
dampen the ardor of the people. Practically
every organization, club, or class at Chautauqua,
besides many individuals, made pledges. Besides
the chorus, there was a children's choir in the
gallery, and one gentleman offered to give a
dollar for every child in it, whereupon scouts were
sent out, boys and girls were gotten out of bed
and brought to the gallery, so that his pledge
cost that gentleman considerably over $300.00.
Before the close of the Assembly $375,000
had been subscribed, inclusive of Mr. Rockefeller's
quota.</p>

<p>Americanization week was from August 11th to
16th, with timely addresses by Prof. Herbert
Adolphin Miller, Prof. Thomas Moran, and a
delightful lecture by Mrs. Beatrice Forbes-Robertson
Hale, on "Reconstruction in England and
America." As a practical illustration of Americanization,
there was a wonderful pageant by the
children of a public school in Pittsburgh, practically
all of foreign lineage. The Recognition
address on August 20th was by Bishop Charles F.
Brent, who after heroic work in the Philippines
had been translated to the Episcopal diocese of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
Western New York. His subject was "The
Opportunities of the Mind."</p>

<p>We must not forget that some lectures were
given at this session by Dr. Charles A. Eastman,
whose name does not suggest, as his complexion
does, that he is a full-blooded Sioux Indian. He
is a successful physician and a graduate of Dartmouth
College,&mdash;which, by the way, was established
in 1750 as a school for Indians, with no
thought of Anglo-Saxon students. This year also
Dr. E. B. Bryan was unable to remain as Director
of the Summer Schools, and his work was added to
the many tasks of President Bestor.</p>

<p>We come finally to the Assembly of 1920, the
forty-seventh session, and at present the last upon
our list, unless we undertake a prophetic look into
the future. We met in sadness, for our great
Founder John Heyl Vincent, who had lived to the
age of eighty-eight years, died on Sunday, May 9th,
at his home in Chicago. He had outlived his
fellow-Founder, Lewis Miller, by twenty-one years.
The two names stand together in the annals of
Chautauqua and in the thoughts of all Chautauquans,
for Chautauqua could not have been
founded by either one without the other, and on
Old First Night, for both together the lilies of the
white handkerchiefs are silently and solemnly lifted,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
and as silently and solemnly lowered. A memorial
service was held for our beloved Bishop and Chancellor
on Sunday afternoon, August 1st, at the
Vesper Hour, in the Hall of Philosophy as the
appropriate place, and the writer of this story,
as the oldest of living Chautauqua workers, was
permitted to offer the tribute in his honor. In the
evening another service was held in the Amphitheater,
at which Dr. John H. Finley, Superintendent
of Education for New York State, and Bishop
Herbert Welch of the Methodist Episcopal
Church, home for a few months from his field in
Korea and Japan, gave addresses. During the
past year Chautauqua had sustained another loss
in the death of Mr. Alfred Hallam, who for nearly
twenty years had been the untiring and wholly
devoted leader of the Musical Department. It
was felt that a musical service was his most appropriate
memorial, and the oratorio "Hora
Novissima," by Horatio Parker, was sung by the
choir and soloists on Sunday evening, August 8th.
During the session news came that Dr. Bethuel
T. Vincent of Denver, long conductor of the
Children's class and Intermediate class in the early
years of the Assembly, had followed his brother
the Bishop, into the silent land. He was remembered
in an address by the writer at a memorial<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
service. His wife, Mrs. Ella Vincent, for many
years president of the Woman's Club, in a few
months also joined the company of the church
triumphant. Another voice often heard at Chautauqua
was stilled this summer, that of Mrs.
Frank Beard, always bright and sunny in her
spirit, who fell asleep in the cottage where she was
abiding, soon after the opening of the Assembly,
fulfilling the wish expressed to a friend a year
before that she might die at Chautauqua.</p>

<p>The most notable feature on the program this
summer was the presence at Chautauqua for
nearly six weeks, from July 26th to August 31st, of
the New York Symphony Orchestra, with daily
concerts, conducted by Ren&eacute; Pollain and William
Willeke,&mdash;a bold venture of the management but
evidently successful.</p>

<p>This was the tercentenary of the landing of the
Pilgrims, and the event was recognized by several
addresses, one in particular by Mr. Charles
Zeublin, on "1620 and 1920." Prof. Weigle gave a
lecture on "Education of Children in Early New
England"; Dr. Alfred E. Garvie spoke on "The
Message of the <i>Mayflower</i> for To-day." Principal
Alexander J. Grieve of the University of Edinburgh
gave lectures on the "Leaders of the Pilgrims,&mdash;John
Robinson and others."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span></p>

<p>Dr. Herbert Adams Gibbons, after an experience
of years in Asia Minor and in France, gave a
series of valuable lectures on "After the War,"
and Mrs. Gibbons narrated the thrilling story of
herself in Turkey, during the massacres of 1908.
Dr. Lynn Harold Hough was chaplain from July
4th to July 10th, and in the morning talks spoke
on the spiritual experiences of St. Augustine,
Martin Luther, and John Wesley, then summed
them up in a conception of "The Christian
Society." Prof. Richard Burton lectured in a
course on "Modern Literary Tendencies,"&mdash;the
essay, the novel, the drama, and other forms of
literature. One of the great acquisitions this year
was Prof. T. R. Glover of Cambridge, England, with
a course of lectures on "The Jesus of History,"
the results of the deepest study of the New Testament
and also of the contemporary Roman world.
Dr. H. Gordon Hayes, just leaving Yale for the
Ohio State University, discussed most ably "Factors
in Labor Unrest." On Roosevelt Day, July
21st, Mrs. Douglas Robinson, his sister, gave
"Recollections of Theodore Roosevelt." In the
week from July 26th-31st, the subject was "Problems
of the Present Day Civilization," discussed
by Dr. E. H. Griggs, Rabbi Louis Wolsey of
Cleveland, and Dr. Cornelius Woelfkin of New<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
York. "Woman and the New Era" was the
theme of the week August 2d-7th, a discussion
participated in by Mrs. Thomas G. Winter, President
of the General Federation of Woman's Clubs;
by Mrs. George Bass, who was the woman, for the
first time in history to preside for a day at the
Democratic National Convention which renominated
Woodrow Wilson; and by Miss Mary
Garrett Hay, the President of the Affiliated
Women's Republican Clubs. August 22d-29th
was the week of the Ministers and Church Workers'
Institute, with addresses by Bishop McDowell
(Methodist), Ozora S. Davis, Shailer Mathews,
Mrs. Helen Barrett Montgomery, and Chancellor
S. B. McCormick, of Pittsburgh.</p>

<p>This was a great year. Subscriptions to the
Comprehensive Plan brought the amount up to
$450,000, including Mr. Rockefeller's contribution,
to be increased if other gifts warranted it. The
Summer Schools were twenty-five per cent. in
income and nearly twenty per cent. in numbers
over 1919, the highest mark of past years. Provision
was made for improving and enlarging the
golf links, and for building a new club house on the
grounds of the golf course.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>

<h3>CHAUTAUQUA'S ELDER DAUGHTERS</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Chautauqua</span>, planted upon the shore of its
Lake, grew up a fruitful vine, and within two years
shoots cut from its abundant branches began to
take root in other soils. Or, to change the figure,
the seeds of Chautauqua were borne by the winds
to many places, some of them far away, and these
grew up, in the course of little more than a generation,
a hundred, even a thousand fold. Many
of these daughter-Chautauquas were organized by
men&mdash;in some instances by women&mdash;who had
caught the spirit of the mother-assembly; others by
those who had heard of the new movement and
saw its possibilities; some, it must be confessed, by
people who sought to save a decayed and debt-burdened
camp meeting, and a few with lots to
lease at a summer resort. From one cause or
another, immediately after the first Assembly had
won success, Dr. Vincent began to receive pressing
invitations to organize similar institutions in many
places. As he was already fulfilling the duties<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
both of an editor and a secretary for the rapidly
growing Sunday School cause, he could accept but
few of these many calls. But a number of younger
men trained by a year or two of experience in
teaching at Chautauqua were around him and to
these he directed most of the enquirers. At least
three Assemblies arose in 1876, two years after
the founding of Chautauqua. Of these I possess
some knowledge and will therefore name them,
but without doubt there were others which soon
passed away and left scarcely a memory.</p>

<p>So far as I have been able to ascertain, the first
gathering to follow in the footsteps of Chautauqua
was the Sunday School Parliament on Wellesley
Island, one of those romantic Thousand Islands in
the St. Lawrence River, where it emerges from
Lake Ontario. This island stands on the boundary
line between the United States and Canada, but
the home of the Parliament was on the Canadian
side of the line. The name "Chautauqua" has
now become generic and almost any gathering in
the interests of the Sunday School, or of general
literature with a sprinkling of entertainment, is apt
to be named "a Chautauqua." But in those early
days the word Chautauqua was not known as the
general term of an institution of the assembly type,
and the new gatherings were named "Congress" or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
"Encampment" or "Institute," and for this
gathering the title "Sunday School Parliament"
was taken, as smacking somewhat of English origin.
Its organizer and conductor was the Rev. Wilbur
F. Crafts, at that time a Methodist minister,
afterwards a Congregationalist, and still at present
working as the head of the International Reform
Bureau in Washington, D. C. He was aided in the
plan and direction by Mrs. Crafts, for both of them
were then prominent leaders in Sunday School
work. It was my good fortune to be present and
conduct the Normal Class during a part of the time.
As compared with Chautauqua, the Parliament
was small, but its spirit was true to the Chautauqua
ideal and it was maintained faithfully for
ten or twelve years. The place had been established
as a camp-meeting ground, but it shared
the fate of many camp meetings in gradually
growing into a summer resort for people in general.
As cottages and cottagers increased the Chautauqua
interest declined, and finally the attempt
to maintain classes and meetings after the Chautauqua
pattern was abandoned, and the island
took its place among the summer colonies in that
wonderful group.</p>

<p>The same year, 1876, saw another camp ground
becoming a Chautauqua Assembly,&mdash;at Petoskey,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
near the northern end of Lake Michigan. Here a
beautiful tract of woodland, rising in a series of
terraces from Little Traverse Bay, about forty
miles south of the Straits of Mackinac, had
been obtained by a Methodist camp-meeting
association, and laid out in roads forming a series
of concentric circles. Here the first Bay View
Assembly was held in 1876, and again in its scope
were combined the camp meeting, the summer
home, and the Chautauqua conception, three
divergent aims that have rarely worked well
together. It will be remembered that on its land
side the original Chautauqua was shut off from
the outer world by a high fence, and everybody
was compelled to enter the ground through a
gate, at which a ticket must be purchased. At
Bay View, as at most camp-meeting grounds,
access was open on every side. At first they
undertook to support the Assembly by collections,
but the receipts proved inadequate, and they
placed a ticket window at each lecture hall and
endeavored to induce the cottagers to purchase
season tickets, a plan which has been pursued
down to the present time. One of the founders of
Bay View, perhaps the one who suggested it, was
Dr. Wm. H. Perrine, an ardent and intelligent
Chautauquan, the rebuilder of Palestine Park.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
Other men came to the aid of the Bay View
Assembly, some of them men of means, who gave
liberally in the form of buildings, an organ, and to
some extent an endowment. One of these was Mr.
Horace Hitchcock of Detroit, another was John
M. Hall, who organized the Bay View Reading
Course, <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'analagous'">analogous</ins> to the C. L. S. C., and by his
personal endeavor built up a reading and book-buying
constituency. I was present at the
second session in 1877, when it was a handful of
people in a wilderness, and again thirty years
later, when I found a beautiful city of homes in
the forest, rising terrace above terrace, with good
roads, fine public buildings, and a body of people
interested in the best thought of the time. Chautauqua
points with pleasure and pride to her oldest
living daughter, the Bay View Assembly.</p>

<p>Mention should be made here of an Assembly
established at Clear Lake, beside a beautiful
sheet of water in northern Iowa, nearly midway
between the Mississippi and Missouri Rivers. It
was organized in 1876, with the Rev. J. R. Berry
as superintendent. For some years, beginning
in 1879, it was under the direction of the Rev. J. A.
Worden, who, like some others of us, had learned
the Assembly trade in apprenticeship to Dr.
Vincent at Chautauqua. For ten years Clear<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
Lake was fairly prosperous, but in time it met
the fate of most assemblies and dropped out of
existence.</p>

<p>During the year 1877 three more Assemblies
arose, one of which remains to this day in prosperity,
while the two others soon passed away. The
successful institution was at Lakeside, Ohio. Like
many others, it was grafted upon a camp meeting
which had been established some years before,
but was declining in its interest and attendance.
The name "Encampment" was chosen as an easy
departure from its original sphere, but after a few
years the name "Assembly," by this time becoming
general, was assumed. The first meeting as
a Sunday School gathering on the Chautauqua plan
was held in 1877, with the Rev. James A. Worden,
who had assisted Dr. Vincent for three years in the
normal work at Chautauqua, as its conductor.
Afterward Dr. B. T. Vincent was in charge for a
number of seasons, and one year, 1882, Dr. John
H. Vincent was superintendent. For many years
all the Chautauqua features were kept prominent,
the Normal Department, with a systematic course,
examinations, and an Alumni Association; the
C. L. S. C. with recognition services, Round
Tables, camp fires, the four Arches, and all the
accessories. Lakeside drew around it helpers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
and liberal givers, and still stands in strength.
Lakeside has the benefit of a delightful location, on
a wooded peninsula jutting into Lake Erie, near
Sandusky City, and in sight of Put-in-Bay, famous
in American history for Commodore Perry's naval
victory in the War of 1812. It still maintains lecture
courses and classes in the midst of a summer-home
community.</p>

<p>Another Assembly began in 1877, with high
expectations, at Lake Bluff overlooking Lake
Michigan, thirty-five miles north of Chicago. It
was confidently supposed that on a direct railroad
line from the great city, Lake Bluff would draw
large audiences, and Dr. Vincent was engaged to
organize and conduct an Assembly upon the
Chautauqua plan, with lecturers and workers from
that headquarters. A strong program was prepared
for the opening session. Among the
lecturers was the Rev. Joseph Cook, at that time
one of the most prominent and popular speakers
in the land. I recall in one of his lectures at Lake
Bluff a sentence, wholly unpremeditated, which
thrilled the audience and has always seemed to me
one of the most eloquent utterances I have ever
heard. It was twelve years after the Civil War,
and on our way to the Assembly we passed the
marble monument crowned with the statue of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
Stephen A. Douglas, the competitor of Lincoln
for the Senatorship and Presidency, but after the
opening of the war his loyal supporter for the few
months before his death. Dr. Cook was giving
a history of the forces in the nation which brought
on the secession of the Southern States. He
referred to Daniel Webster in the highest praise,
declaring that his compromise measures, such as
the Fugitive Slave Law, were dictated by a supreme
love for the Union, which if preserved would
in time have made an end of slavery, and he added
a sentence of which this is the substance.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Had it been given to Daniel Webster, as it was
given to Edward Everett, to live until the guns were
fired upon Fort Sumter, there would have been an end
of compromise. He would have stamped that mighty
foot with a sound that would have rung throughout
the land, have called forth a million men, and might
have averted the war!</p></div>

<p>Just then a voice rang out from one of the seats&mdash;"As
Douglas did!" Joseph Cook paused a
moment. His chest swelled as he drew in a breath,
and then looking at the man who had interrupted
him, he spoke in that powerful voice:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The firmament above the massive brow of Daniel
Webster was a vaster arch than that over the narrow<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
forehead of Stephen A. Douglas, and the lightning
that rent the clouds from the dying face of one,
would never have been needed to bring daylight
to the other!</p></div>

<p>I was seated beside the Rev. Charles F. Deems
of New York, a Southerner by birth and in his
sympathies through the then recent war. He
turned to me and said: "That was the most
magnificent sentence that I have ever heard!"
There was a moment of silence, and then a burst
of applause from the audience.</p>

<p>The Lake Bluff Assembly never drew a large
patronage, as no Chautauqua Assembly ever has
which depended upon a great city whose inhabitants
can hear the famous preachers and orators.
The successful Assemblies have been located in
fairly large towns, with villages and small cities
surrounding, near enough to reach the Assembly,
but so distant that to enjoy its benefits the visitors
must stay more than one day. The support of a
Chautauqua Assembly of the higher grade comes
not mainly from the one-day excursionists, but
from those who plan to enter the classes and
remain at least a fortnight. These patrons constitute
the backbone of the institution, and without
them the transitory crowds soon lose their interest
and the Assembly declines. Lake Bluff maintained<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
an existence for ten or twelve years, but
never obtained an extensive constituency.</p>

<p>The year 1878 was noteworthy in the establishment
of two Assemblies, one still living after more
than forty years, the other one of the largest, most
steadfast in fidelity to the Chautauqua ideal, and
most extended in its influence. The first of these
was the Round Lake Assembly, at a camp ground
near Saratoga in New York. We have narrated
elsewhere (see page 44) the story of the "praying
band leader" who undertook to hold a little meeting
of his own at Chautauqua, and when called to
order left in disgust, but later showed his manly
spirit by asking Dr. Vincent to organize an Assembly
on the Chautauqua plan on the grounds at
Round Lake, of which camp meeting he was
President. This Assembly began in 1878, and is
still maintained both as a summer school, a camp
meeting, and a Sunday School training institution.
It was opened according to the Chautauqua pattern,
with an evening of short speeches, of which
some at least were supposed to blend humor with
sense. Frank Beard was on the platform, and was
expected to be the wit of the evening. To the
blank perplexity of all, he made a serious speech,
without a solitary funny allusion. The audience
did not know whether to laugh or to look solemn,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
as he talked on, and at last brought us all "before
the great white throne." The next morning at
breakfast&mdash;for all the imported workers took our
meals at one table in the Round Lake Hotel&mdash;Dr.
Vincent freed his mind to Frank Beard, somewhat
after this fashion:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Now, Frank, I want you to understand that we
bring you here to brighten up the program with a
little fun. We don't need you to make serious
speeches; there are plenty of men to do that; I can do
it myself, a great deal better than you can. To-night
I'm going to give you another chance, and I expect
you to rise to the occasion with something to laugh at.</p></div>

<p>So, before the evening lecture, Dr. Vincent
announced that Mr. Beard wished to say a few
words. This was something of what he said:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Dr. Vincent, he didn't like the speech I made last
night. He told me this morning before all these
fellers that it was too eloquent, and he said, "Mr.
Beard, when you are eloquent you take the shine off
from me, and these other men, and you mustn't do
it. If there is any eloquence needed, I will do it
myself, and you mustn't interfere with the regular
program."</p></div>

<p>Then he went on, in his usual way, using some
of the dear old jokes that some of us had heard at
Chautauqua, but polished up for a new constituency.
Everybody saw that he was guying the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
doctor, but there was a group of us present who
knew just how Frank was twisting the breakfast
talk of the Superintendent of Instruction.</p>

<p>On the shore of Round Lake, near the Assembly
ground, a copy of Palestine Park had been constructed,
and daily lectures were given there. It
was just a few feet larger than the Park at Chautauqua,
as we were informed by the President.
Let me correct the report that a big Methodist
bishop arriving late one night, and enquiring
the way to the hotel, fell into the clutches of the
most mischievous small boy in the region, who told
him:</p>

<p>"The gates are all shut and you'll have to climb
the fence yonder."</p>

<p>He did so, according to the story, and fell from
the top of the fence into the Dead Sea, which at
once swelled its waters and washed away the city of
Jericho. The eminent divine, it is said, drenched
with water and spattered with mud, walked up the
Jordan Valley and over the mountains of Ephraim,
destroying the cities and obliterating sundry holy
places; one foot caught in Jacob's Well, and his
head bumped on Mount Gerizim. He reached the
hotel at last, but the next morning showed the land
of Palestine in worse ruin than had been wrought
by Nebuchadnezzar's army. All this I, myself,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
read in a New York newspaper that is said to
contain "All the news that is fit to print"; but
I here and now declare solemnly that there is not a
shred of truth in the story, for I saw the Bishop,
and I saw the Park!</p>

<p>The Round Lake meetings are held to this day,
courses of lectures are given, and classes are held.
But the Park of Palestine, which was to surpass
Chautauqua's Park, is no more. It was built on
swampy ground, after a few years sank under the
encroaching waters of the lake, and was never
restored.</p>

<p>The other institution founded in 1878 was the
Kansas Chautauqua Assembly. It was organized
by the Rev. J. E. Gilbert, then a pastor of a
Methodist Church in Topeka, who was an active
Sunday School worker and started other assemblies
during his different pastorates in the Middle
West. It was held for three years at Lawrence,
then at Topeka for two years, and finally in 1883
located at Ottawa, about fifty miles southwest
from Kansas City. Most of the Assemblies already
named were held upon camp grounds, but
the Ottawa Assembly was unique in its location
upon the large Forest Park just outside the city,
leased for this purpose by the authorities. Being
public property, no cottages could be built upon it,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
but a city of three hundred tents arose every
summer, and after a fortnight were folded and
taken away. For nearly twenty years this Assembly
was under the direction of the writer,
and in every respect followed the lines laid down
by its parent Chautauqua. Buildings were put
up for classes, which served as well for the annual
agricultural fair in the fall. In our first year at
Ottawa, our normal class was held out of doors,
the members seated upon the unroofed grand stand
of the Park, and I was teaching them with the aid
of a blackboard. Clouds began to gather rapidly
and a storm seemed to be in prospect. I paused
in the lesson and said:</p>

<p>"I am somewhat of a stranger here&mdash;how long
does it take a thunder storm to arrive?"</p>

<p>"About two minutes!" responded a voice from
the seats; and instantly there came a rush to cover,
leaving the history of the Bible to care for itself.
We were just in time, for a minute later it was
blowing a hurricane, bending the great trees and
breaking their branches. I had heard of Kansas
cyclones, had been shown a "cyclone cellar," and
only the day before had taken dinner in a house of
which one end had been blown clean off by a
cyclone. As we stood in a building which we had
named "Normal Hall," I asked a lady by the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
window, "Is this a cyclone?" She glanced without
and then calmly said: "No, this is a straight
wind."</p>

<p>In ten minutes the tornado was over and we
reassembled for the lesson. Kansas people seemed
to accept occurrences like this as all in the day's
work. One weather-story of Kansas reminds of
another. On my first visit to that State in 1882,
the last year of the Assembly at Topeka, I was
standing in front of the hotel, thinking of the
historic events in Kansas,&mdash;where the Civil War
actually began, though unrealized at the time,&mdash;when
I saw nearby a rather rough looking, bearded
individual. Thinking that he might be one of the
pioneers, with a story to tell of the early days, I
stepped up and began in the conventional way by
remarking:</p>

<p>"I don't think it's going to rain."</p>

<p>He looked me over and responded:</p>

<p>"Wal, strangers from the East think they know
when it's goin' to rain and when it ain't; but us
fellers who've lived in Kansas thirty years never
know whether it'll rain in five minutes or whether
it won't rain in three months."</p>

<p>The Ottawa Assembly was one of the best in the
Chautauqua system. The people of the city built
for its use a large tabernacle and halls for classes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
Beside the park flows the River Marais du Cygne,
"the Swamp of the Swan," celebrated in one of
Whittier's poems; and on a bank overlooking the
river was erected a Hall of Philosophy, copying the
old Hall at Chautauqua, except that its columns
were lighter and ornamented, improving its
appearance. We followed the Chautauqua programs
as far as possible, having many of the same
speakers on our platform and Professor Sherwin to
lead the music, succeeded later by Dr. H. R. Palmer.
The teacher-training work, then called the
Normal Class, was maintained thoroughly, with
adult, intermediate, and children's classes,&mdash;all
wearing badges and following banners. The C. L.
S. C., with all its usages of camp fires, Recognition
Day, vigil, procession and arches, was kept
prominent. We established a Chautauqua Boys'
Club, and Girls' Club also. We could not conduct
a summer school, as the meeting lasted only a
fortnight, but we had lecture courses of high
character upon literature. Kansas contained
more old soldiers in its population than any other
State in the Union, and the Grand Army Day at
Ottawa was an event of State-wide interest. Some
distinguished veterans spoke on these occasions,
among them General John A. Logan, Major
William McKinley, and General John B. Gordon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
of the Confederate Army; also Private A. J.
Palmer of New York, whose "Company D, the
Die-No-Mores," roused enthusiasm to its summit.
One element in Ottawa's success was the steadfast
loyalty of the city,&mdash;a place then of seven or eight
thousand people, which enjoyed a special prohibitory
law some years earlier than the rest of the
State. Almost every family had its tent in Forest
Park and lived there day and night during the
fortnight of the meetings. Another cause of its
prosperity was its able, broad, and continuous
management. Its President for many years was
the Rev. Duncan C. Milner, a Chautauquan from
his boots up to his head, and laboring with untiring
energy in its behalf.</p>

<p>I must tell an amusing story of our camp fire one
summer. As the ground was by this time well
occupied, we decided to have the bonfire on a raft
out in the stream, while the crowd sang the songs
and listened to the speeches from the Hall of
Philosophy on the shore. But when we met at
night for the services, the raft and the materials
ready for lighting had disappeared! We were told
that the janitor had thought it an improvement to
have the fire lighted above, in a bend of the river,
and float down to the Hall. We waited, not
exactly pleased with the janitor's unauthorized<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
action, and after a time we heard a mighty racket.
The raft with the bonfire was floating down the
stream, while around it was a convoy of about a
hundred boats, loaded with boys, and each boy
blowing a horn or yelling in the most vociferous
manner. That put an end to any prospect of
songs and speeches, for who could command silence
to such a din? But that was not all nor the worst.
The janitor tried in vain to anchor his raft, but
it still floated downward. We saw our camp fire
sail majestically down the river, until it approached
the mill dam and the falls, when the
boys desperately rowed their boats out of danger.
Raft and contents went over the falls and the bonfire
was quenched in the devouring flood. As we
saw it going to its doom, I distinctly heard the
word "dam" spoken, and I fear it was intended to
include a final "n." But that was the last attempt
at a camp fire. When I proposed one at the next
season, the entire Round Table burst out with a
roaring laugh.</p>

<p>The success of Ottawa led to the opening of
many other Assemblies all over the State, and by
degrees weakened this, the mother Chautauqua of
Kansas. It is still maintained, but in a small way,
as one of the chain Chautauquas.</p>

<p>In 1879, a Sunday School Congress which soon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
grew into an Assembly was held at Ocean Grove,
on the Atlantic Coast, almost the only place where
the camp meeting, the summer resort, and the Chautauqua
idea have lived together in mutual peace and
prosperity. But even at Ocean Grove the Assembly
has been overshadowed, almost out of sight, by the
camp meeting and the summer boarding-house contingent.
For several seasons I took part in the
work, and in 1881 conducted the Children's Class.
On the next to the last day I told all the children
to meet me at our chapel, naming the hour when
the tide would be at its lowest, every child to
bring a pail and shovel, or a shingle, if his shovel
had been lost. We formed a goodly procession of
three hundred, marching down the avenue, myself
at the head. At the beach I had selected a suitable
area, and set the children to constructing
out of the damp sand a model two hundred feet
long of Palestine, the land of which we had been
studying in the daily class. It was a sight to see
those young nation builders, making the coastline,
piling up the mountains, and digging out the
Jordan valley with its lakes. Some Biblically inclined
gentlemen aided in the supervision, and apparently
a thousand people stood above and
looked on. When it was finished I walked up and
down the model, asking the children questions<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
upon it, and was somewhat surprised to find how
much they knew. Some whose conduct in the
class gave little promise were among the promptest
to exploit their knowledge. It was my purpose to
leave the map that it might be seen by the multitude
until the tide should wash it away. But the
boys shouted, "Can't we stamp it down now?"
and I rather reluctantly consented. Palestine has
been overrun, and trodden down, and destroyed by
armies of Assyrians, Babylonians, Turks, Crusaders,
and many other warriors, but the land never
suffered such a treading down by the Gentiles as on
that morning at Ocean Grove.</p>

<p>In the year 1879, the wind-wafted seed of
Chautauqua was borne to the Pacific Coast and an
Assembly was founded at Pacific Grove in Monterey,
California. I know not whether it remains,
but the Grove has been the place of meeting for the
California Methodist Conference year after year.
Another Assembly combined with the summer
resort was established this year at Mountain Lake
in Maryland, a charming spot, whose elevation
beside a lovely lake brings coolness to the summer
air.</p>

<p>One more Assembly established in 1879 must not
be forgotten. In the early years of Chautauqua
we used to see a plainly clad man, who from his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
appearance might have been a farmer or a lumberman;
in fact, he was the proprietor of a large saw
and planing mill. This man was at every meeting,
listened intently and took full notes, for he was
intelligent, reading good books, and ardent in his
devotion to Chautauqua. For years he was one of
my friends, but, alas! I have forgotten his name.
He lived in Northern Indiana, and in 1879 was
able to interest enough people to start an Assembly
at Island Park at Rome City, Indiana, not far
from the Michigan line. He became its Secretary,
managed its finances, and called upon the Rev. A. H.
Gillet, one of Dr. Vincent's lieutenants, to conduct
it. For many years Island Park was one of the
foremost children of Chautauqua in its program
and its attendance. It was situated upon an
island in a lovely lake, with bridges leading to the
mainland, where most of the tents and cottages
were placed, and where buildings were erected for
the normal classes and the kindergarten; the
Tabernacle, seating 2500, being upon the island
which was bright with flower beds amid winding
paths. For years Island Park was a center of
Chautauqua influence and strong in promoting
the C. L. S. C., but like many other Assemblies,
it failed to receive financial support and was
abandoned.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span></p>

<p>Two great Assemblies, both closely following the
path of Chautauqua, were founded in the year
1880. One of these was Monona Lake, near Madison,
Wis. It was established by the State Sunday
School Association, its founder and first president
being the Hon. Elihu Colman of Fond du Lac.
Like Ottawa in Kansas, it was an assembly of
tents, not of cottages. The first session, a small
gathering, was held in 1880 on the shores of Green
Lake, one of the five hundred lakes of Wisconsin;
but in the following year it was removed to Monona
Lake, one of the five surrounding the capital city,
Madison. After Mr. Colman, the Rev. F. S. Stein,
D.D., became President, and for nearly a generation,
Mr. Moseley, a bookseller of Madison, was
its efficient secretary, business manager, and organizer
of its programs. The standards of Monona
Lake were high and its work was thorough, but
for lack of adequate support, it was given up after
nearly thirty years of usefulness and the point
became an amusement park.</p>

<p>Among those prominent in the early seasons
at Monona Lake was the Rev. O. P. Bestor, who
was active in promoting the C. L. S. C. He
brought with him his son, who began as a small boy
attending the Assembly, and formed the assembly-habit
so strongly that in the after years he grew<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
up to be the President of the Chautauqua Institution&mdash;Albert
E. Bestor, LL.D.</p>

<p>The other notable Chautauqua started in 1880
was the New England Assembly at South Framingham,
Mass., originally in closer affiliation with
the original Chautauqua than any other Assembly,
for it chose Dr. Vincent as Superintendent of
Instruction, and many of its speakers were also on
the Chautauqua program. It drew from all the
New England States, until its success led to the
establishment of other Assemblies at Fryeburg,
Maine, at Northampton, Mass., and at Plainville,
Conn. One of Dr. Vincent's assistants at the
Framingham Assembly was the Dr. A. E. Dunning,
at first Congregational Secretary of Sunday
School work, later Editor of the Congregationalist.
Dr. Vincent, after a few years, gave the Assembly
into the hands of Dr. Dunning and the writer, and
sometimes we conducted it jointly; at other times
in successive years. On an eminence overlooking
the grounds and the adjoining lake arose another
Hall of Philosophy, like the one at Chautauqua, and
all the Chautauqua customs were followed&mdash;C. L.
S. C., Normal Class, Children's Classes, and the
rest. The first President was the Rev. William
R. Clark, who was instrumental in locating the
Assembly upon the ground of a camp meeting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
which it succeeded. It was continued for more
than a generation, but at last succumbed to changing
times. Perhaps it might have continued longer,
if throughout its history it had not been encumbered
by the debts of the former Camp Meeting
Association.</p>

<p>Our chapter has already grown beyond bounds.
We would like to tell the stories of Monteagle,
Tennessee, of Mount Dora, Florida, of De Funiak
Springs, also in Florida, of the Arkansas and Dakota
and Southern California Assemblies. In fifteen
years after Chautauqua began there were nearly a
hundred Assemblies, each independent of all the
others, yet all in friendly relation to the oldest
and greatest of them all, the mother&mdash;Chautauqua
by the Lake.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXV</h2>

<h3>YOUNGER DAUGHTERS OF CHAUTAUQUA</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">We</span> have seen how Chautauquas sprung up
throughout the land, inspired by the example of
the original Assembly beside the lake. All these
were independent, arranging their own programs
and securing their own speakers. Chautauqua
never took a copyright upon the name or a patent
for the idea. It was natural, however, for many
of these Assemblies to combine their interests, for
it soon found that half a dozen Chautauquas in
the same section could save expenses by employing
the same group of speakers and passing them on
from one gathering to another. There were already
lyceum bureaus offering lecturers and entertainers.
At first the Assemblies secured a few
of their speakers from these offices, and after a few
years their entire programs were arranged in
conjunction with the bureaus. Finally the lyceum
agencies began to organize and conduct assemblies
directly, and thus the Chautauqua circuit or
the system of a Chautauqua chain was developed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
One office in Chicago, the Redpath Bureau, is said
to conduct three thousand Chautauqua assemblies
every year, others have charge of a thousand
apiece, while there are lesser chains of fifty, twenty-five
or a dozen assemblies. I have been officially
informed that in the year 1919, ten thousand
chain Chautauquas were held in the United States
and Canada. They are to be found everywhere,
but their most popular field is in the Middle West,
where "the Chautauqua" is expected every year
by the farming communities. These bureaus and
the "talent" which they employ have been combined
in an organization for mutual interest, to
avoid reduplication in the same locality, to secure
their workers and arrange their programs. This
is named the International Lyceum and Chautauqua
Association, holding an annual convention at
which the organizers and the participants upon
the programs come face to face and form their
engagements. The circuit system has arisen
largely through economic causes; the saving of
expense by efficient organization, the elimination
of long railroad jumps from Assembly to Assembly,
guarantee of continuous engagement to attractive
speakers, better publicity, and the concentration of
responsibility. It is found that the most successful
Chautauquas are held, not in cities, nor even<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
in large towns, but in the smaller places. The
town of a thousand, or even one as small as five
hundred inhabitants, during its annual Chautauqua
week will rally from the farms and hamlets
two thousand people to hear a popular lecture,
five or seven thousand during the week. In each
place an advance agent appears, interviews the
business men, the ministers, and the heads of any
clubs or improvement societies, and obtains
pledges of support by the sale of a definite number
of tickets. College boys make up the tent crews;
a Scout Master organizes the Boy Scouts; and
trained experts arrange for the advertising. The
"morning-hour men" give lectures in courses of
uplifting nature on civic and national questions;
the popular features of the program are supplied
by entertainers, musical troupes, bands, artists, and
dramatic companies. It is a fact of deeper significance
than many recognize that political leaders
find here the greatest forum for their messages.
Many of these orators receive more than fees for
their speeches; they come near the heart of the
people, they reach their constituencies and disseminate
their views more widely than through
any other agency. Some political reformers have
won not only prominence, but power through
these chain Chautauquas.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span></p>

<p>It may be remembered that while the Hon.
William Jennings Bryan was Secretary of State he
received some criticism and even ridicule for "hitting
the Chautauqua trail" and "going off with
the yodelers." On that subject the <i>Baltimore
Sun</i> said in an editorial:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>If it could be demonstrated, we would be willing
to wager that the average Chautauqua student has
a far better knowledge of public questions than the
average of those who sneer. And whether he likes
it or not, no public official of to-day can afford to
disregard the Chautauqua movement.</p></div>

<p>Mr. Bryan himself gave this testimony in the
<i>Review of Reviews:</i></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The Chautauqua affords one of the best opportunities
now presented a public speaker for the discussion
of questions of interest to the people. The
audience is a select one, always composed of the
thoughtful element in the community, and as they pay
admission, they stay to hear. I believe that a considerable
part of the progress that is now being made
along the line of moral and political reform is traceable
to the influence of the Chautauqua.</p></div>

<p>A writer in <i>The Outlook</i> (September 18, 1918)
says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I have studied the Chautauqua speakers. They
command the admiration of the honest critic. They
deal with serious subjects as experts. They carry
men, women and children on to the conclusion of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
the longest lecture by knowing when to lighten at
the proper moment with a story or a lilt of humor, or
sometimes a local reference. Said a village woman in
my hearing of a fellow-speaker on the problems of
patriotism, "I thought at first he would be hard to
follow, but I surely hated when he had to stop."
The thermometer was reported to be 105&deg; in the tent.
The speaker held the rapt attention of the people for
an hour and a half in a philosophical presentation of
the causes of the war and our responsibilities in consequence.
It was like reading a solid book and
condensing it with marked success into one hearing.
It was typical, and twenty millions are reported to be
listening to such addresses in Chautauqua tents the
country over.</p></div>

<p>In the magazine <i>The World To-Day</i> (September,
1911), I read the following by George L. Flude:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>A few years ago I saw Senator Robert M. La
Follette address a crowd of eight thousand people at
Waterloo, Iowa. For two hours and a half he jammed
insurgent Republicanism into that crowd. He was
at that time the only insurgent in the party and had
not been named yet. The crowd took it all in. They
were there to be instructed, not to hear a partisan
speech. Hence their attitude, regardless of party
affiliation, was a receptive one. He absolutely converted
that crowd into insurgents and they did not
know it. For five years La Follette crammed and
jammed "non-partisan" talks into Chautauqua
crowds through Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, Ohio, Nebraska,
and Kansas. The average audience was probably<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
about four thousand and he met sixty or more
audiences each summer; 240,000 people inoculated
with insurgency by one man.</p></div>

<p>Occasionally an audience finds that the lecture
is not what was looked for. Some years ago a
Western Assembly engaged Senator La Follette,
and from the list of his subjects chose "The
World's Greatest Tragedy," expecting a sensational
attack upon the greed of capitalists.
A great crowd assembled to see "Senator Bob
jump on the trusts." He gave his well-known
literary lecture on <i>Hamlet</i>, a critical appreciation,
without a word on current affairs. The crowd
sat, first puzzled, then baffled, and at last went
away dejected.</p>

<p>A newspaper of wide circulation, <i>The Christian
Science Monitor</i>, said:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>By far the most active and keenly interested voters
of the country, with their leaders, forceful in shaping
progressive legislation, have come during the last
decade from States where this Chautauqua method of
cultivation of the adult population has been most
steadily used, and the end is not yet, since now the
system is being organized in a thorough-going way
never known before. Public men, educators, artists,
authors, pioneers in discovery of unknown lands or
of secrets of nature, who get the ear of this huge
audience season after season, come nearer to the heart<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
of the nation and observe its ways of living better
than by any other method.</p></div>

<p>The old mother Chautauqua by the Lake would
not like to be held responsible for all the utterances
under the tents of her ten thousand daughters.
For that matter, she would not endorse everything
spoken upon her own platform in the Amphitheater,
where "free speech" is the motto and the
most contradictory opinions are presented. But
she must recognize that her daughters have wielded
a mighty power in forming the political and moral
convictions of the nation.</p>

<p>The bell which rang at Fair Point on August 4,
1874, to open the first Assembly, might be compared
to "The shot heard 'round the world" from
Concord Bridge in 1775, for in answer to its call
ten thousand Chautauquas have arisen on the
American Continent. The question might be
asked, Why have none of the ten thousand rivaled
the first, the original Chautauqua?</p>

<p>Many of these opened with a far better outfit
of external accommodations, with more money
expended upon their programs, with greater advertising
publicity, with more popular attractions.
Yet now at the period of almost fifty years,
not another among the ten thousand, either of
the earlier or the later Assemblies, holds a two<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
months' program, conducts courses of study of a
wide range, or brings together even one quarter of
the assemblage which every year gathers upon the
old Chautauqua ground. All the assemblies which
were established with the highest promise have
either been abandoned or are continued as chain
Chautauquas, meeting for a week only. Let us
endeavor to answer the question&mdash;Why does the
mother-Chautauqua still stand supreme?</p>

<p>In the judgment of this writer, who has known
Chautauqua almost from the beginning, and has
taken part in fifty similar gatherings, the reasons
for its supremacy are easily seen and stated. It
was established by two men of vision, one of whom
was also a practical man of business, and both men
of high ideals which they never lowered and from
which they and their successors have never
swerved. In its plans from first to last, there was
a unique blending of religion, education, and
recreation. No one of these three elements has
been permitted to override the two others, and
neither of them has been sacrificed to win popularity,
although on the other side, popular
features have been sought for within just limits.
Never has the aim of Chautauqua been to make
money; it has had no dividends and no stockholders.
It has opened avenues and leased lots<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
to hundreds of people, but it has not sought financial
gain. Neither of its Founders nor any of
their associates have been enriched by it, for all
profits&mdash;when there have been any&mdash;have been
expended upon improvements or enlargement of
plans. It has shown the progressive spirit, while
firm in its principles, open to new ideas, willing to
listen to both sides of every question. It has
sought to attract and to benefit all classes in the
community, not setting the poor against the rich,
nor the rich against the poor, giving a welcome to
scholars of every view and to churches of every
doctrine. It has maintained a continuous, consistent
administration, fortunate in finding able
and broad-minded men to carry forward the conceptions
of its founders. Few changes have been
made in its management and these have been
without a revolution or a renunciation of principles.
Men at the head have changed, but not
the policy of the institution. It has remained
unshaken in its loyalty to the Christian religion
and penetrated through and through with the
Christian spirit, without flying the flag or wearing
the badge of any one denomination of Christians.
These have been the principles that placed Chautauqua
at the front in its beginning and have kept
it at the front through forty-eight years.</p>
